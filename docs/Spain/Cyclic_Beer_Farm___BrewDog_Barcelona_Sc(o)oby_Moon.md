| **Comments** | Gooseberry fool kiwi lychee lemon tart in the aroma. Pours hazy pale greenish yellow body and thin halo. Sharp sour taste that sets the taste buds jangling. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a surprisingly soft finish. I could not drink this regularly but it impresses. |
