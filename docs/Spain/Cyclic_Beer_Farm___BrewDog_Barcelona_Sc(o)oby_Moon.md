Brewer: Cyclic Beer Farm
City: Barcelona
Comments: Gooseberry fool kiwi lychee lemon tart in the aroma. Pours hazy pale greenish
  yellow body and thin halo. Sharp sour taste that sets the taste buds jangling. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a surprisingly soft
  finish. I could not drink this regularly but it impresses.
