| **Comments** | Can from One For the Road beer shop in Mestre. I was not expecting a Catalan beer. Poured pale golden with a lively foam top. The aroma has straw and tropical fruits; pineapple mainly. The taste is medium sweet with some citrus and papaya notes; then a slow fade to a bitter finish. Medium bodied, reasonably smooth, average carbonation for a canned beer, and a little NEIPA chalkiness in the finish. Very session worthy. |
