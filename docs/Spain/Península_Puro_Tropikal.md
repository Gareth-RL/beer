| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body with dissipating white lace. Aroma has mango, satsuma and grapefruit notes with some background graininess. Taste is medium sweet with some caramel malt evident, slow transition to a light sweetness but the sweet malt persists in a way that I don't associate with IPAs as a rule. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and after some delay, a bitter finish. While one can quibble about its qualities as an IPA, it remains a very nicely flavoured and presented beer that I can imagine would taste even better in the Castilian sunshine. In the cloudy gloom of my basement flat, it's refreshing.  |
