| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy amber brown with halo of thin white lace. Aroma is fruity peach and candyfloss with some piny resinous background. Taste is medium sweet and light bitterness &#40;but not pronounced as the blurb implies&#41;. This is a gentle concoction. Palate is medium bodied but sticky and that adds to the effect. Carbonation is soft and the finish while bitter is also demure. Overall an unpretentious little nothing. |
