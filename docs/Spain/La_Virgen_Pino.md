| **Comments** | Aroma has more malt than piney resinous hops despite what the label claims. It pours a golden orange with thin white lace. Taste was also not your traditional lager style even allowing for the maltiness of the Vienna variant. Medium to light bitter. Palate was medium bodied only texture average carbonation and a light finish. To be generous this would be easy drinking but disappointing. |
