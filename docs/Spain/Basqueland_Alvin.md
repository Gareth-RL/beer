| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. I would appear to be the first Brit to taste and rate this. Unsurprisingly it&#39;s dark bodied and has a tan lace halo. Aroma is equally predictably dark malts with pronounced chocolate coffee and caramel notes in descending order. Taste is medium to full sweet with a bitter finish. Palate is full bodied and only when I focused on the body did the vanilla filter through. &#40;that may just be me&#41;. Rich creamy texture, flat to soft carbonation, and a  finish that could last until toothpaste. Anyone who drinks 10.5% imperials by the pint should seek medical especially psychiatric assistance, but as a finale they have a place. Given the prevalence of positive Danish reviews I am forced to suggest that Denmark is the Basqueland of Scandinavia except it is free. |
