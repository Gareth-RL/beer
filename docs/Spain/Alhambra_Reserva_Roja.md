Comments: 'Bottle from Ali supermarket Mestre Venezia. Poured dark amber body off
  white foam lacing with yeast spots. Aroma of roasted malts and grassy hop. Medium
  sweet to bitter a little caramel malt and a touch of grass hop but both light and
  fleeting. Medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  A decent bock for 1.19 euro. '
