| **Comments** | Bottle from minimarket on island of Silba, Croatia. Pours dark brown with amber lights, and diminishing tan lace. Aroma has a range of malty notes, coffee, dark fruit, a hint of licorice; so thus far, it's not bad. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some light caramel in the first half before a souring transition. Hence taste is where it starts a downward curve. Palate deepens the downfall. Medium bodied, grainy plastic texture, over carbonated in the bottle version at least, and a souring finish. Like the Pivo from the same brewer, it does not leave a great aftertaste. Nevertheless, the Dunkel is better than the standard lager. It clearly divides opinion on here with surprisingly some of the Scandinavian connoisseurs being tolerant (3+) but others from countries as diverse as USA, Poland and Germany, rating it as slightly better than bilge-water. Thus, I am in the kinder camp. |
