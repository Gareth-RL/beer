Brewer: Bujska Pivovara

Comments: Bottle bought in Pula as insurance that I would have one decent beer while
  off on the islands. Poured dark brown with no head to speak of. Aroma has a little
  coffee and licorice. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with some toffee notes.
  Medium bodied smooth enough in texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.
  Overall the beer is above average for Croatian multinational output, and so-so for
  craft output.
