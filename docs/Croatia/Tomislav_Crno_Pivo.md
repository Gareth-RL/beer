| **Comments** | Bottle at the bar on landing on the island of Silba. Poured dark brown with ruby lights. diminishing lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Strongly malted with dark fruits in the scent and a little coffee and toffee in the taste. Not a lot of hop action. Palate is medium bodied, grainy, average carbonation, and a slight bitter finish. A strong lager should send me to sleep this afternoon after getting up at 4am. |
