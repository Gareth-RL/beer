Beer: Pan Pilsner
BeerID: 833898
Brewer: Carlsberg Croatia (Carlsberg)
City: Koprivnica
Comments: Can from a local minimarket. Pours clear golden with thin white lace and
  the flow of bubbles is a sure sign of high carbonation. The scent has pale bready
  malts and herbal/grassy hops. I was expecting worse! Taste is medium sweet with
  the same combination with something added for the Satz effect. The palate is medium
  bodied with some cling in the texture, plenty of gas, and a bland slightly metallic
  finish. My unscientific survey of industrial lager continues to find the palate
  is the main defect. But since I was expecting the Pan to be as bad as the others
  this is an improvement and it is widely available on this small island off Zandar.
