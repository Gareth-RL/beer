| **Comments** | Pours pale golden with thin diminishing lacing. Aroma is faint but there are pale bread malts and maybe other cereals. Taste is medium sweet but not a lot going on, maybe green apples. As with the rest of these lagers, the palate is dire. Medium bodied, sticky texture, over carbonated in the can at least, and a ghastly aftertaste. You drink more trying to wash it away. But it's 34 degrees and the beach so that's another reason for drinking anything cold. They got me. |
