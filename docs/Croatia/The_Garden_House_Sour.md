| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy golden with thin lace top. Aroma lemon and pine.. Taste is medium sour with a light initial sweetness. Palate is light to medium body, slick feel. Soft carbonation. Some languor. There must be a story behind it&#39;s being here alongside more familiar US, UK, Belgian beers. Clearly it has fans close to home, but it was neither s sour nor a wheat beer for me. |
