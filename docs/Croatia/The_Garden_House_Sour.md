Comments: '"Tap. Pours hazy golden with thin lace top. Aroma lemon and pine.. Taste
  is medium sour with a light initial sweetness. Palate is light to medium body, slick
  feel. Soft carbonation. Some languor. There must be a story behind it&#39;s being
  here alongside more familiar US, UK, Belgian beers. Clearly it has fans close to
  home, but it was neither s sour nor a wheat beer for me."'
