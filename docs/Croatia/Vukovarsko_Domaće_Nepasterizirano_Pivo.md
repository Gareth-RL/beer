Comments: '"Can from a minimarket. Another beer to be snobby about. It pours golden
  pale with little to no head after the initial evescence. The scent is similarly
  understated: metal and veg, which is not exactly what a beer-lover seeks. It tastes
  neither particularly sweet nor bitter, maybe a hint of pale bread malt and some
  corn syrup. It''s medium to thin bodied, not much in the way of texture until you
  get to the finish when it wraps itself around the palate like a bland straitjacket.
  An average 2.69 seems high, and one wonders why it was revived and why Molson Coors
  keep it going--it must be cheap to produce. Unless it is very hot --avoid. My can
  was binned."'
