| **Comments** | Can from a minimarket. Another beer to be snobby about. It pours golden pale with little to no head after the initial evescence. The scent is similarly understated: metal and veg, which is not exactly what a beer-lover seeks. It tastes neither particularly sweet nor bitter, maybe a hint of pale bread malt and some corn syrup. It's medium to thin bodied, not much in the way of texture until you get to the finish when it wraps itself around the palate like a bland straitjacket. An average 2.69 seems high, and one wonders why it was revived and why Molson Coors keep it going--it must be cheap to produce. Unless it is very hot --avoid. My can was binned. |
