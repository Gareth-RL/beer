Comments: 'Poured black with little lace. Aroma has nutty coffee malts and light herbal
  tang. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but the latter is still strongly malted. Not
  a lot of hop action perhaps. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and
  a bitter finish. Overall a beer that was improved by the location in Pula. A nice
  pizzeria near the forum '
