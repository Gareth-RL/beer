| **Comments** | Poured black with little lace. Aroma has nutty coffee malts and light herbal tang. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but the latter is still strongly malted. Not a lot of hop action perhaps. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a beer that was improved by the location in Pula. A nice pizzeria near the forum  |
