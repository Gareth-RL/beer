Brewer: The Garden Brewery
City: Zagreb
Comments: Can from BirraGoGo Milan. Poured black cola body with diminishing brown
  tan lace.Aroma of cocoa and dark malt with just a hint of raspberries. Certainly
  not overpowering. Taste is predictably sweet with the chocolate still more evident
  than the coconut. Some raspberry fruit detected and also definite lactose taste.
  Anyone who complains about the sweetness of a pastry stout should read the label
  more carefully. While this is rather limited in range of flavour, it does deliver
  the chocolate raspberry coconut combination albeit in an unbalanced way. It keeps
  a smooth texture, carbonation is soft to average and there is no alcohol burn in
  the finish which some imperials have. So I am contented. I had to find some way
  of celebrating England beating Germany in a competitive game since it probably will
  not happen again in my lifetime!
