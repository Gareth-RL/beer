| **Comments** | Can in the fridge of an apartment rental on the island of Silba. I can now join all the many many beer connoisseurs and be snobbish about this very bland lager. It pours cleaer golden with white foam lace, diminishing. Aroma has apples and plastic. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with more grain than hops all the way. For me, what makes it a standard industrial lager is the palate. The longer it lies in the mouth the less you like it. So swig it down. It's medium bodied, grainy textured, average carbonation, and it has a long finish that sours and becomes more chemical. This may be the first of a number of similar beers I will try before I leave this very nice island! |
