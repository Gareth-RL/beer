Comments: '"Can from BirraGogo, Milan. Pours black body with coffee crema top. Aromatically,
  the tonka is dominant with coffee and vanilla all pushing the caramel into fourth
  ranking. Taste is predictably sweet with the vanilla and caramel pulling the cacao
  onto the sweet side, although the coffee provides a bitter finish. The oats provide
  the smoothness to justify the pastry label and the texture is not as heavy as the
  ingredients might lead you to expect: so, medium bodied, smooth feel, average to
  soft carbonation and a bitter finish with the abv well managed overall. Certainly
  has the ingredients of a dessert stout and as such, it is an end of the evening
  choice: can''t imagine anyone wanting to drink several at a time! Personally, it
  could go lighter on the tonka and allow the coffee to come through more."'
