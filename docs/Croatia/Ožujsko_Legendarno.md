| **Comments** | Can from a minimarket on the island of Silba as I continue my enforced tasting of industrial Croatian beer. Pours an amber body with thin off-white broken lacing. Aroma of lightly caramel malts and fruit hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with again more malt than hop and more sweetness than bitterness. As with the others, the main issue is palate: medium bodied, reasonably smooth but with some residual stickiness in the finish, that leaves a sour aftertaste. Nonetheless, compared to others this one is reasonable enough, although unspectacular for an anniversary brew. Let's hope the next 130 years produce something of greater distinction |
