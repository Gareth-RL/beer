Brewer: Zagrebačka Pivovara (Molson Coors)
City: Zagreb
Comments: '"Can from a minimarket on the island of Silba as I continue my enforced
  tasting of industrial Croatian beer. Pours an amber body with thin off-white broken
  lacing. Aroma of lightly caramel malts and fruit hops. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter with again more malt than hop and more sweetness than bitterness.
  As with the others, the main issue is palate: medium bodied, reasonably smooth but
  with some residual stickiness in the finish, that leaves a sour aftertaste. Nonetheless,
  compared to others this one is reasonable enough, although unspectacular for an
  anniversary brew. Let''s hope the next 130 years produce something of greater distinction"'
