Comments: '"Tap. Pours orange golden with white broken spot lace. Aroma melon and
  tropical fruit salad. Taste richly textured medium sour with a veneer of bitterness
  and a splash of sweetness. It tastes stronger than it is although that is strong
  enough. Palate medium to full bodied, thick texture, but the finish is a hard to
  define final note that melds bitter and sour qualities . It could damage more than
  New England as an opinoid since I fancy a second. &#40; Fortunately I am strong
  willed and parsimonious&#41;."'
