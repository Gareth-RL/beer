| **Comments** | Bottle. Bought because I have never tried a Grodziskie beer, although it's a gamble to see if this Italian microbrewery can produce a good German/Polish wheat beer.  Pours pale yellow with lace halo. Aroma has a little smoke and a hint of green apple. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with the smokiness lurking in the background and coming through in the finish (sub indeed). Palate is light to medium bodied smooth, soft to average carbonation, and the lightly smoked finish. Overall, it strikes me as a beer that can be enjoyed in a summer beer garden, and given the strength, it is sessionable. I did not detect the Sicilian rock salt. |
