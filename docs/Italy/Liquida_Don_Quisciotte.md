Comments: Can from One For the Road in Mestre. Poured hazy golden body thin lace diminishing to halo. Aroma has pineapple and resinous hops. Taste is lightly sweet but thanks to the strong pine note it is mainly bitter with a long finish. Medium to light bodied, smooth texture, soft carbonation and the long bitter finish. Certainly refreshing but I did wonder if I would want a second of the same.
