BeerID: 1002995
Brewer: Doppio Malto Brewing Company
City: '"Erba &#40;CO&#41;"'
Comments: Poured rich red amber body off white lace with yeast spots. Light hops and
  heavy roasted malts scent. Light sweet to bitter/sour mash finish  A little caramel
  malt and some hoppiness.  Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation
  and a slightly sticky finish. Certainly not my standard ipa.
