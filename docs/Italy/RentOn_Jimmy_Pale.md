Brewer: RentOn
City: '"Fano &#40;PU&#41;"'
Comments: Bottle from One for the Road Mestre. Pours golden bodied with white lace
  top. Aroma is piney grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet biscuit but quickly bitter
  with some sharpness in the finish. Refreshing. Texture is medium bodied, smooth
  with average carbonation and a bitter finish. An easy drinking summer ale and as
  good as many an APA I have encountered elsewhere.
