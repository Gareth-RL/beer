Comments: '"Bottle from Beerbanti shop in Venice. Have you ever drunk a Baltic Porter
  and thought: what''s missing here are the Tunisian dates. (me neither). Pours dark
  brown body rapidly diminishing off white lacing. Aroma has coffee, licorice, and
  now that you mention it, dates. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with licorice lingering.
  Palate is medium to thin bodied, slightly sticky, soft to average carbonation, and
  a light bitter finish. Certainly drinkable but not exactly top of its class."'
