Comments: '"Can from One for the Road. Poured clear golden body with white foam lacing.
  Aroma has green apple hop fruits and pale malt. Taste is lightly sweet to medium
  bitter with a sour bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, slightly chalky mouth
  feel, average carbonation, and a dry mineral finish. With me, the crucial thing
  with a session IPA is could I imagine having this as my beer for an evening? My
  answer would be No. It''s refreshing enough but it doesn''t leave me wanting more."'
