| **Comments** | Poured brown amber slightly cloudy body with off white foamy head. Aroma has roasted malts  light coffee and toffee nutty notes. Taste is medium sweet  with a hoppy backbone producing a bitter finish.  Palate is medium bodied oily texture but over carbonated (it's not an easy pouring beer). It's not going to displace Newcastle Brown but it may complement a lasagne better. |
