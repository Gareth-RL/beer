BeerID: 233223
Brewer: Le Baladin
City: Piozzo
Comments: Poured a hazy golden with diminishing white lace top.  Aroma has some yeasty
  esters and spicy herbal hops.  Taste is medium sweet to drying bitter with a slight
  note of soft cheese. Texture is medium bodied oily feel average carbonation and
  a dry bitter finish.  Session worthy but a word of warning to the tickers of different
  beers. Baladin teamed up with a graphic artist to design a new can series. The design
  changes in the Star Days series but the beer remains the same!
