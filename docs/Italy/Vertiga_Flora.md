Beer: Vertiga Flora
BeerID: 990209
Brewer: Vertiga
City: '"Rossano Veneto &#40;VI&#41;"'
Comments: Poured copper body thin lace top. Aroma of floral hops and bread malts.
  Medium sweet to bitter; some fruit but apricot-like, but swift transition to bitter
  hoppiness. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.
  Overall, a pretty decent American pale in type with a floral scent worthy of the
  name.
