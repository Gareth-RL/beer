Brewer: Lucky Brews
City: '"Montecchio Maggiore &#40;VI&#41;"'
Comments: Can from One for the Road, Mestre. Pours an amber golden body with full
  white foam lacing. Aroma is predictably hoppy with piney, grassy notes predominating
  over citrus. Taste is lightly sweet with an intensifying and drying bitterness evident
  in the transition and a definite edge in the aftertaste. Texture is medium to light
  bodied, some coating in the finish, soft to average carbonation, and that lingering
  bitter finish. I should admit that whereas I am drawn to Imperial Stouts for their
  richness and complexity, I am ambivalent about Imperial IPAs since they can be simply
  hops on steroids. With both, I wish I could share the serving since it is almost
  always too much. This is still very good in its type with the abv well managed and
  the hops well blended. Recommended.
