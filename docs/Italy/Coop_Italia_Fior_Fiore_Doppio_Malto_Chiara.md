Comments: '"I''m not sure why so many see this as below 3.0 beer. Pours golden body
  white lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts sugar and herbal hops.  Medium sweet with
  a toffee note and a  light bitter transition that then sours in the finish. Medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter to sour mash finish. It may
  be reviewers expecting either a Belgian Dubbel or a German strong Bock. It''s not
  a great example of either, but for less than 2 euros, it works for me. Produced
  at Pedavena so may need a merger at some point and my bottle said 6.8 abv."'
