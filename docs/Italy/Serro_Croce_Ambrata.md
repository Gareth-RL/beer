| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured cloudy fizzy red brown body with loose foamy yeasty head. Aroma yeasty malt loaf.  Medium sweet with some caramel and dark stone fruit notes. About a third of the pour was foam so over carbonated, light to medium bodied grainy texture and lightly souring in the finish. This is a hard beer to grade. Aroma and initial taste are strong pluses but it has suffered in the bottle and finish and fizz speak against it. |
