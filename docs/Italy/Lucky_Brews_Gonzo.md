Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Lucky Brews Gonzo
BeerID: 832179
Brewer: Lucky Brews
City: '"Montecchio Maggiore &#40;VI&#41;"'
Comments: Pours golden body with lasting foamy white head. Aroma is strongly hoppy
  with just a hint of pale malts; and the kind of fruit scent I associate with fruit
  gums if you remember them! Taste is medium bitter, drying moderately to the finish.
  Texture is medium bodied but emphatically tongue coating with the kind of chalky
  mineral quality that some hops seems always to leave in their wake. Carbonation
  is average. Overall, this remind me of the nearest on the spectrum of English bitter
  to session IPA. Thus more English than American in style and certainly session-worthy;
  if I ever had sessions these days. Can from One for the Road in Mestre-Venezia (not
  Bolton!).
