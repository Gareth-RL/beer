Comments: 'Poured hazy orange golden body white lace. Aroma strongly citrus mandarin
  grapefruit lemon. Taste is medium sweet to sour with the same fruits dominant but
  with a zesty quality that accentuates the souring finish. Palate is medium bodied
  grainy texture average carbonation and a sour fruit finish. Overall a very solid
  example of a pale ale with New World hops '
