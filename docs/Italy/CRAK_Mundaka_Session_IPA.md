Beer: CRAK Mundaka Session IPA
BeerID: 717589
Brewer: CRAK Brewery
City: '"Campodarsego &#40;PD&#41;"'
Comments: can from One for the Road Mestre-Venezia. Pours hazy orange gold with the
  characteristic Citra hop scent of tangerine and pineapple with just a hint of pith.
  Taste is lightly sweet transitioning smoothly to a bitter finish. Some lasting mouth
  coating from this medium bodied IPA, soft to average carbonation and a slightly
  mineral or chalky finish. A worthy example of the hop blend and comparable to many
  a US brew I have sampled.
