| **Comments**  | Bottle was in the cellar for nearly a year. Poured deep red chestnut, rapidly diminishing and thin lace. Rich maple scent with vanilla notes, and I guess the booze notes are Bourbon. Taste is full sweet with lots of toffee and fruitcake alongside the maple syrup; thus rich and complex would cover it. Full bodied, smooth textured, soft carbonation, and a long finish. Overall the alcohol is well managed with just a hint of burn in the finish and the maple syrup too is not overwhelming. So delicious but too strong for my stomach these days                                                                                      |
