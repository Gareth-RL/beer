| **Comments** | Bottle for Ali supermarket Mestre. Pours copper body fleeting lace. Aroma of roasted malt and metal. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some light caramel and hints of alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied smooth, average carbonation, and a warm finish. It may be a single Bock judging by the Italian description although at 8.2% it is heading towards a doppelbock. Cheap and cheerful |
