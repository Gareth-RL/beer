BeerID: 922714
Brewer: Vertiga
City: '"Rossano Veneto &#40;VI&#41;"'
Comments: Can. Yellow golden body full foaming white lace top. Aroma of hop fruits
  with pine and lemon. Taste is medium to light sweetness to medium bitterness with
  a pleasant pale malt spine. Medium to light bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. In short a decent session IPA should you need one in Italy
  this summer.
