| **Comments** | Can. Yellow golden body full foaming white lace top. Aroma of hop fruits with pine and lemon. Taste is medium to light sweetness to medium bitterness with a pleasant pale malt spine. Medium to light bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. In short a decent session IPA should you need one in Italy this summer. |
