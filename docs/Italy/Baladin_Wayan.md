Comments: This explains how Italian beer is intrinsically related to food. Pours hazy
  golden with white lace. The aroma has a kitchen sink full of herbs and floral notes
  coriander and cinnamon stood out for me. Taste is medium sweet through sour with
  spicy notes evident. Palate has medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and
  a long ambiguous finish - is it sweet, sour, bitter or all three? Overall it deserves
  to be paired with Pad Thai.
