Brewer: San Gabriel
City: '"Ponte di Piave &#40;TV&#41;"'
Comments: Bottle from farm shop near Marcon (between Mestre & Treviso). Pours copper
  amber body, thin and fading lacing. Caramel malt and grassy hop with maybe a hint
  of radicchio once you know it is there. Lightly sweet but more emphatically bitter
  which again might be the salad influence. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation for a bottle that is, and a bitter finish. The farm shop was selling
  a range of San Gabriel beers on the basis that they used produce from the farm;
  I hope the other two are better.
