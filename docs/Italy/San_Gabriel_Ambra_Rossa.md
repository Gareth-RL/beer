| **Comments** | Bottle from farm shop near Marcon (between Mestre & Treviso). Pours copper amber body, thin and fading lacing. Caramel malt and grassy hop with maybe a hint of radicchio once you know it is there. Lightly sweet but more emphatically bitter which again might be the salad influence. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation for a bottle that is, and a bitter finish. The farm shop was selling a range of San Gabriel beers on the basis that they used produce from the farm; I hope the other two are better. |
