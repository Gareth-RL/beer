| **Comments** | Aroma has some malt but muted hop (brewer promises floral. ) Pour amber gold body thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied clammy/creamy texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. In the Wetherspoons festival but hardly a measure of the Italian beer scene. |
