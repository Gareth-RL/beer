Comments: '"10/17/20 Far be it from me to sing the praise of very ordinary  lager
  but I  have tasted worse. Poured golden body white top.  Aroma has grassy hop and
  pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a decent malt spine. It''s a bit
  thin and watery in the mouth with average to fizzy carbonation which doesn''t help.
  But as a supermarket lager it seems to be damned too strongly or rated too miserly.
  07/01/24 second sipping since a friend brought a six pack to Xmas dinner and it''s
  July and there they sit. Air-conditioning and lager is my remedy for summer heat
  in the Veneto. "'
