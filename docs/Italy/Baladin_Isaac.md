| **Comments** | Poured a hazy golden body with white foam top.  Aroma has the promised camomile which gives a spicy , herbal note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a yeasty quality. Palate is light with oily texture soft to average carbonation and a sour finish. The witbier I have enjoyed have had a stronger banana flavour from the yeasts and a greater sweetness. But this is okay. |
