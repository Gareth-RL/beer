Brewer: Le Baladin
City: Piozzo
Comments: Poured a hazy golden body with white foam top.  Aroma has the promised camomile
  which gives a spicy , herbal note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a
  yeasty quality. Palate is light with oily texture soft to average carbonation and
  a sour finish. The witbier I have enjoyed have had a stronger banana flavour from
  the yeasts and a greater sweetness. But this is okay.
