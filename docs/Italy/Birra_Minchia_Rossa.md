BeerID: 393135
Brewer: Birra Minchia
City: Messina
Comments: Bottle from a street food fair in the Parco Albanese, Mestri. Poured murky
  reddish brown; the lacing is thin, and quickly dissipates. Aroma has lightly roasted
  malts, and a little hop fruit but nothing stands out. Taste is medium sweet with
  again more sweet malt than hop fruits. Transition is more a fade than a change.
  Medium bodied, slightly sticky feel, average carbonation and a souring finish. Rather
  underwhelming. I suspect its qualities can be concealed by fine Sicilian cooking
