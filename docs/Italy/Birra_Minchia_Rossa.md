| **Comments**  | Bottle from a street food fair in the Parco Albanese, Mestri. Poured murky reddish brown; the lacing is thin, and quickly dissipates. Aroma has lightly roasted malts, and a little hop fruit but nothing stands out. Taste is medium sweet with again more sweet malt than hop fruits. Transition is more a fade than a change. Medium bodied, slightly sticky feel, average carbonation and a souring finish. Rather underwhelming. I suspect its qualities can be concealed by fine Sicilian cooking                                                                                      |
