| **Comments** | Poured amber body with white diminishing foam head. Aroma has roasted malt and herbal hops.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. A little caramel noted. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to full carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Sometimes the pursuit of balance is at the expense of character.  |
