| **Comments** | Aroma is yeasty rather than malty. Despite the doppio malto in the description. Pours pale yellow gold with foamy white lace. Taste is medium to full sweetness souring to a light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. I doubt a Belgian would be impressed and this provincial Brit is bemused. Incidentally the wine in Campania is very good and inexpensive so this may be a unique rating. |
