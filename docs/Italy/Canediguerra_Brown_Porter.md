Beer: Canediguerra Brown Porter
BeerID: 350679
Brewer: Canediguerra
City: Alessandria
Comments: Bottle from One For the Road, Mestre. Pours cola body with thin diminishing
  lace halo. Aroma is surprisingly complex with nut, liquorice and coffee notes from
  the rich malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with some caramel accentuating
  the first and some liquorice deepening the latter. Texture is medium bodied, smooth
  feel, average to soft carbonation and a light liquorice tang. Overall, it tastes
  richer than a 3.8% beer and reminded me of how much I miss English porter! Second
  sipping 27/12/21 still very good.
