Comments: '"Bottle from One for the Road in Mestre. My first beer from Abruzzo. So
  it has traveled. Poured murky orange with no foam. Aroma is frankly cheesy. Taste
  is medium sour with prolonged fruit notes. It''s not redolent of either acacia or
  elderberry for me. They are background noises. Medium bodied mouth coating soft
  carbonation and a drying finish. It would go well with sunshine on a beach instead
  of a misty Xmas Eve on the Venetian lagoon."'
