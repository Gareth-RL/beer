| **Comments** | Poured a cloudy amber with full foam off white top. Aroma has caramel malt and spicy peppery hops. Taste is a similar blend of sweetness merging with an increasingly bitter spice mix from the hops. This is more pleasant than it sounds! My only gripe is with the slightly high carbonation for a medium IPA. There was some lively effervescence on opening and the slightly floured mouthfeel goes oddly with this fizz. It helps sustain the bitter finish. Overall, a decent IPA that for me is hard to rank. While overall the quality is fine, in each individual aspect there is something that dissatisfies. Too much herbal hop in the scent? Too much murk in the appearance. Not enough balance in the taste? Too much fizz in the body? Maybe it's a beer best savoured in Rome. |
