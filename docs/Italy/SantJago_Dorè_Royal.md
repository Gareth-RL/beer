| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops. Pours reddish amber body with foamy off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet malts to light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. A decent brown ale although the bottle is more impressive than the beer itself. |
