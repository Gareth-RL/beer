Brewer: War Birrificio
City: '"Cassina de’ Pecchi &#40;MI&#41;"'
Comments: Can from One For the Road in Mestre. Poured pale golden body loose white
  lacing. Piney hop scent. Lightly sweet to medium bitter with resinous quality throughout.
  Some lemon citrus. Light to medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. Overall a decent pale ale, even if lacking in complexity. There
  are worse examples!
