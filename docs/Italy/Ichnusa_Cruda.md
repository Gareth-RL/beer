Beer: Ichnusa Cruda
BeerID: 180471
Brewer: Ichnusa (Heineken Italia)
City: Assemini
Comments: cereal, spruce, aroma if only faintly. A golden beer with thin white circle
  of lace. The main advantage for Ichnusa beers is the Sardinian sun. Every beach
  bar has it and after a week of white wine, I succumbed. This version is unfiltered
  but that hasn’t boosted the taste much. Pale malts to the front and some sour hops
  in the finish. You can get a white foam head if you rush the pour, but that might
  overdo the excitement of a bland blond thirst quencher.
