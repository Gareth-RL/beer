| **Comments** | cereal, spruce, aroma if only faintly. A golden beer with thin white circle of lace. The main advantage for Ichnusa beers is the Sardinian sun. Every beach bar has it and after a week of white wine, I succumbed. This version is unfiltered but that hasnâ€™t boosted the taste much. Pale malts to the front and some sour hops in the finish. You can get a white foam head if you rush the pour, but that might overdo the excitement of a bland blond thirst quencher. |
