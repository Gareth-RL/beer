| **Comments** | Bottle from One For the Road Mestre. Poured amber body and off white lacing. Richly scented with New World hops some  citrus some pine some melon, some herb. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a relatively rapid transition to the latter which is long and drying in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth enough but drying, average to soft carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Certainly refreshing and true to the style |
