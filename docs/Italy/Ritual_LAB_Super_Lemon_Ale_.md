Comments: '"Bottle from One For The Road Bottleshop in Mestre-Venezia. Poured amber
  body white lace. I was expecting much paler given the name and the type of beer
  and the scent similarly is not overwhelmingly lemony. There is certainly citrus
  but quite a bit of roasted malt in the nose. Medium sweet but more lastingly bitter,
  some mango or peach at the front and some pine in the finish. Altogether not the
  lemon bath I expected. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average to soft carbonation
  after a fizzy pour. Long bitter finish. So, it''s the perennial dilemma. Do you
  rate the experience (which is pleasant enough) or the beer according to its pretensions
  as lemon-focused Citra-hopped APA? The drinkability would make a 3.3 at least, but
  the divergence from expectations of a Super Lemon Ale make it a 3.1."'
