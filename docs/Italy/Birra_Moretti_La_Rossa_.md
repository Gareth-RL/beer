Comments: Bottle. It was either this or the pale. Aroma has caramel, cereal, bread,
  notes. Pours reddish brown , clear, minimal white foam. Taste medium sweetness,
  lightly bitter, medium body, average carbonation, and sticky finish. It survived
  alongside a curry in Venice so deserves some respect. 28/08/24 second sipping and
  it still has my respect if not my devotion. On a beach near Jesolo.
