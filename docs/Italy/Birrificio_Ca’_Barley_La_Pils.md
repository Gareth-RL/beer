| **Comments** | Poured pale golden body with white foam top. Aroma has grainy bread note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied oily texture and a sour finish.  My limited experience of pilsner has left me expecting a crisper clean mouth feel which is the opposite of this beer. But it's on a par with others l have tasted in the Veneto. |
