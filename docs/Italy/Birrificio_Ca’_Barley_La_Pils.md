Comments: '"Poured pale golden body with white foam top. Aroma has grainy bread note.
  Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied oily texture and
  a sour finish.  My limited experience of pilsner has left me expecting a crisper
  clean mouth feel which is the opposite of this beer. But it''s on a par with others
  l have tasted in the Veneto."'
