Brewer: Birrificio Messina
City: Messina
Comments: Bottle from the local Aldi. I am continuing my tour of bargain Euro lagers;
  this one was less than a euro. Aroma of pale bread malt and a hint of hop. Poured
  golden body with white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Unsurprisingly, there
  is not a lot going on in this beer. All that can be confirmed is that it is a none
  too crisp lager. Medium bodied lightly grained average to soft carbonation especially
  for a bottled beer. Bitter finish. But boy is it bland. On the positive side I tick
  another Sicilian beer from my Venetian hideaway (clutching at straws)
