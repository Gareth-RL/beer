Beer: Lüf Rossa
BeerID: 561287
Brewer: Birrificio Lüf
City: Seriate
Comments: Bottle from Hyperlandia supermarket in Mestre. Pours a rich red copper body
  but thin rapidly fading off-white lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and red fruits.
  Medium sweet to bitter with caramel malt in the fore taste and grassy hops in the
  finish. Medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, average carbonation (bottled), and
  a bitter finish with herbal aftertaste. I am trying to think of the last English
  pub I went into that had a beer advertised as Irish Red; maybe they include the
  ambers and ESBs. In any case, it is pleasant enough
