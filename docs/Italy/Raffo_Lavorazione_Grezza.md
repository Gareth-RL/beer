Comments: '"Bottle from Coop Mestre. Foolishly thought the reference to Puglia on
  the label might indicate it was from there, but it''s a Peroni in disguise. Poured
  golden body thin white lace. Strong pale malt aroma. Medium sweet to bitter with
  the cereal note lasting throughout. Medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. I guess the best that can be said is that it is a slightly
  different kind of Keller."'
