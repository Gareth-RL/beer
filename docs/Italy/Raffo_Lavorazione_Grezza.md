| **Comments**  | Bottle from Coop Mestre. Foolishly thought the reference to Puglia on the label might indicate it was from there, but it's a Peroni in disguise. Poured golden body thin white lace. Strong pale malt aroma. Medium sweet to bitter with the cereal note lasting throughout. Medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. I guess the best that can be said is that it is a slightly different kind of Keller.                                                                                      |
