| **Comments** | Poured dark brown almost black body with tan cream lacing diminishing. Aroma of stone fruit, berries, licorice and coffee. Taste is more of the same with a fruity sweetness that surprisingly stays above the dark malt base. Palate is medium bodied, some graininess in texture, soft to average carbonation and a mouth-coating finish. Comparing ratings, it seems a bit of a Marmite beer with some loving and some loathing, and a persistent indifference among Italians. Well, I liked it. |
