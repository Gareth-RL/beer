BeerID: 174680
Brewer: Azienda Agricola Altùris (Birra Gjulia)
City: '"Cividale Del Friuli &#40;Udine&#41;"'
Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body with tan cream lacing diminishing. Aroma
  of stone fruit, berries, licorice and coffee. Taste is more of the same with a fruity
  sweetness that surprisingly stays above the dark malt base. Palate is medium bodied,
  some graininess in texture, soft to average carbonation and a mouth-coating finish.
  Comparing ratings, it seems a bit of a Marmite beer with some loving and some loathing,
  and a persistent indifference among Italians. Well, I liked it.
