Comments: '"Bottle at the Ca'' Rezzonico cafe overlooking the Grand Canal. A beer
  more memorable for the location and occasion than for itself. Poured reddish brown
  body with off-white lace. Roasted malt aroma and a little berry fruit. Taste is
  medium sweet to lightly bitter with a light caramel note. Palate is medium bodied,
  slightly sticky texture, average carbonation, and light faintly metallic finish
  4/9/24 if this is the same as Coop doppio molto rossa intense, it tastes better
  in the bottle than at the taphouse "'
