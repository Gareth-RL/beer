Comments: 'Poured hazy brown orange body with thin off white foam. Aroma has definite
  ginger note with a mellow honey  malt scent. Taste is medium sweet but the spice
  is evident throughout.  Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a spicy ginger finish. I am not sure myrrh and ginger are anymore traditional
  than kalmut in a traditional ale but it went well with prosciutto. '
