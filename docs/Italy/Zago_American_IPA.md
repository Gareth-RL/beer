Comments: Poured amber body off white foam top.  Aroma of roasted malt and floral hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with light caramel and a spiced bitter note. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a definite spice finish.  Branded Superior IPA on the label but abv etc correspond to APA rather than IPA.  However, very unamerican in taste. A birthday gift
