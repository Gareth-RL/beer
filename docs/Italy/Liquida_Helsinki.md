| **Comments** | Can from One for the Road Mestre. Pours cola black body with halo of tan cream lace. Aroma of roasted malts and coffee grounds. Taste is lightly sweet with a growing bitterness. Texture is medium bodied, average to soft carbonation, sticky feel, and a bitter finish. Overall, it hinges on how bitter you like your porter. If you favour the sweeter malts, then this is not likely to please but if you see a sharper edge as intrinsic to the Baltic tradition, this is a good example. |
