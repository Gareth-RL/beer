| **Comments** | Poured reddish brown body thin lace swirl. Aroma of wood smoke and nutty malts. Taste is similar but with more definite smoked meat. Palate is light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a smoky finish. Decent attempt at a Rauch. 01/01/24 still pleasantly meatye |
