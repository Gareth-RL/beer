BeerID: 170751
Brewer: Brewfist
City: '"Codogno &#40;LO&#41;"'
Comments: Tap at Baladin Open in Turin. Pours dark brown with creamy tan foam top
  that yields lasting lacing. Aroma has chocolate cake and coffee malts. Taste is
  medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, smooth feel, soft carbonation,
  and a long creamy finish. This grew on me. There are flaws in texture and balance
  but overall a decent Imperial Porter.
