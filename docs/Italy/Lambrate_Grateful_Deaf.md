| **Comments** | Tap at Open Balodin Turin. Pours ruby brown with tan lace top. Aroma has roasted malts with coffee and chocolate notes. The taste has chili which is not well judged as you are distracted by the heat. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and the heat persists to the end. Maybe an Italian brewery should try it without the Jalapenos. Nonetheless it&#39;s interesting and I suppose it went with the guacamole wrap I ordered. |
