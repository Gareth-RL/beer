Comments: '"Tap at Open Balodin Turin. Pours ruby brown with tan lace top. Aroma has
  roasted malts with coffee and chocolate notes. The taste has chili which is not
  well judged as you are distracted by the heat. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture,
  average carbonation and the heat persists to the end. Maybe an Italian brewery should
  try it without the Jalapenos. Nonetheless it&#39;s interesting and I suppose it
  went with the guacamole wrap I ordered."'
