| **Comments** | Purchased at the farm shop in Marcon. Poured amber body with white foam lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and piney hops. Lightly sweet with just a hint of caramel before the bitterness takes over, and by my lights, it has quite a harsh spiced pine finish. Medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation (bottled), and a bitter finish. One step away from home brew, and one step down from Sierra Nevada. |
