| **Comments** | A bottle picked up from a local street market selling beers from Monza. Poured dark brown body with a superabundance of tan foam (my glass was 2/3rd foam). Aroma of toasted roasted malts with coffee and a hint of licorice. Lightly sweet but that is rapidly succeeded by an acidic bitterness that grows and lingers. Medium bodied but in the bottle gassy, smooth enough texture but too much acid in the bitter finish. I am a porter fan and this does not do justice to the style. Robust does not always translate as 'rough.' |
