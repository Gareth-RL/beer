Brewer: Orso Verde (O V)
City: '"Busto Arsizio &#40;VA&#41;"'
Comments: Can from One for the road Mestre. Pours  golden with white lace rapidly
  diminishing. The aroma has light citrus and pale bread malts. Taste is lightly sweet
  to bitter with grainy malt crispness intensifying over the transition to produce
  a dry finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a dry bitter
  finish. After a week of industrial lager, it makes a pleasant change.
