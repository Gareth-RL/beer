| **Comments** | Can from One for the road Mestre. Pours  golden with white lace rapidly diminishing. The aroma has light citrus and pale bread malts. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with grainy malt crispness intensifying over the transition to produce a dry finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a dry bitter finish. After a week of industrial lager, it makes a pleasant change. |
