| **Comments** | Pours a rich reddish amber with thin beige head. Aroma of caramel malt and hop fruits. Taste is medium sweet with malt dominant to begin, then a tart hop finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation slightly sticky feel and a bitter finish. Some yeasty notes in there. Overall, a pleasant enough Doppelbock by this Lombardian brewer. Bought at One For the Road bottleshop in Mestre 27/12/23 second sipping still good enough  |
