Comments: 'Bottle from Ali my local supermarket in Mestre. Peroni has this label to
  signal better than average and this is better than the average Peroni  Hoppy scent
  hay and grass. Poured pale amber body white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with some decent malt flavour. Medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Still an industrial lager but '
