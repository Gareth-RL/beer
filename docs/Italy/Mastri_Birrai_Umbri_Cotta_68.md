Brewer: Mastri Birrai Umbri
City: '"Gualdo Cattaneo &#40;PG&#41;"'
Comments: Bottle from Ali supermarket in Mestre. Poured hazy golden amber with rapidly
  diminishing lace. Aroma of toasted breast malts and stone fruits. Taste is medium
  sweet with plums and apricot detected. Transition is towards sour but the alcohol
  adds a hint of bitterness. Average except for the texture which is medium by somewhat
  sticky. It detracts. Not great for the abv,
