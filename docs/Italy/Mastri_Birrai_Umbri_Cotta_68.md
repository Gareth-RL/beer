| **Comments** | Bottle from Ali supermarket in Mestre. Poured hazy golden amber with rapidly diminishing lace. Aroma of toasted breast malts and stone fruits. Taste is medium sweet with plums and apricot detected. Transition is towards sour but the alcohol adds a hint of bitterness. Average except for the texture which is medium by somewhat sticky. It detracts. Not great for the abv, |
