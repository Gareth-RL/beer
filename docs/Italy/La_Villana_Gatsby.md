| **Comments** | Poured amber body with off white foam top.  Aroma has hop fruits and yeasty esters  as well as bread malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a pleasant hoppy finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture and a drying finish. Not a classic ESB since these aren't associated with yeasty scents. Overall  good but why name an English  beer after the hero of a classic American novel? |
