Overall: 11.0
MyScore: 3.2
Comments: Poured a lively slightly cloudy amber body with a white foam that settled to a thin lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and citric floral hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a swift transition and a long bitter finish; the hops dominate but there is still some roast malt evident. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, long bitter finish. Overall an APA that could easily pass for an IPA
