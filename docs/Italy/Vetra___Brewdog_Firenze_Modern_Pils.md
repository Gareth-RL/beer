| **Comments** | Pours golden body with white lace. Aroma heavily herbal grassy hops not the Pils I know. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but obscured by palate issues. So I expect a Pilsener to be crispy. This is medium bodied sticky feel average+ carbonation and a bitter finish. It's  more modern than Pils in my view. |
