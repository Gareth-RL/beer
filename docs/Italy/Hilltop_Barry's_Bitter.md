| **Comments** | Tap at Baladin Open . Pours amber body with white foam top. Aroma has hop fruits and bread malts. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sweet. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and the proverbial if light twiggy finish. I appear to be the first Englishman to taste Barry&#39;s Bitter. It is a bitter and the tongue twister is: Is Barry&#39;s Bitter better bitter than a British bitter back in Britain? |
