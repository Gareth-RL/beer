Comments: Poured brown body tan lace. Aroma nutty malt . Taste is medium sweet to bitter with nutty flavour and a definite roasted malts quality. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. This may well be the first Italian attempt at a Mild I have encountered. It's safe. Bought at a beer festival!
