Comments: '"Poured brown body tan lace. Aroma nutty malt . Taste is medium sweet to
  bitter with nutty flavour and a definite roasted malts quality. Medium bodied grainy
  texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. This may well be the first Italian
  attempt at a Mild I have encountered. It''s safe. Bought at a beer festival!"'
