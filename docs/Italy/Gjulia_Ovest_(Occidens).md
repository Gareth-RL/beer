Comments: '"Poured copper brown body and tan foam top, extravagantly so from the bottle:
  beware! Aroma is richly malty with dried fruit notes. Taste is medium sweet with
  caramelised malts paramount. Light bitterness in the finish.  Medium bodied, sticky
  texture, average carbonation,  and bitter biscuit finish. One of the better craft
  beers I have found in Italy. Watch out for the sediment. 06/01/25 still good. "'
