Comments: Poured golden body white lace top.  Aroma of resinous pine hops and light
  toffee malt. Medium sweet to bitter with grapefruit initially more drying pine in
  the bitter finish.  Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a long
  bitter finish. It is decent enough, especially when chilled.
