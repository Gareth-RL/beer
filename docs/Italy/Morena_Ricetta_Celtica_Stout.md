| **Comments** | Poured dark almost black body with thin fading lace top. Aroma of vanilla and chocolate malts with light spice notes. Taste is medium sweet with milky chocolate quality transiting to spicy finish with an aniseed finish. Palate is a weakness since it has too much carbonation for a stout. Overall this is emphatically the pick of the Celtica ricette although the spicy herbal hop used will not please all sweet stout drinkers. |
