Comments: '"It''s interesting that the Brits like it better than either the Belgians
  or Italians. I am closer to the latter. Mine poured frothy, diminishing to thin
  off-white lace, and one could still see the bubbles spiralling to the top. The scent
  was lemony, a little coriander, but less ripe banana than some. Medium sweet, some
  more citrus, a little spice, and a bread finish but again modest. Medium bodied,
  smooth texture, but gassy, and a pretty bland finish. Baladin can do better. A local
  supermarket in Mestre had a range of three Open beers. 22/12/24 second sipping.  Still
  fizzy but a bit of banana scent. Taste too is boosted more lemon more coriander
  and a little banana. Shame about the excess effervescence.  Still available at Eurospesa
