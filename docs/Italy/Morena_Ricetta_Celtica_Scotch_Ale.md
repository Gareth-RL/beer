| **Comments** | Pours amber body with thin lace top that diminishes. Aroma of toasted malts that never quite caramelized so it's more like the sauce on an ice cream than toffee. Taste is initially sweet with caramel malts detected but it then sours as if someone had poured mixed herbs onto soft toffee and the finish is not something you want to last, but it does. Palate is medium bodied but sticky especially in the finish carbonation is average. The finish is herbal and sour. This is a  curiosity. It is one of a range of Celtica recipe beers some of which are rated by others on this site and with several experienced raters registering reservations and yet the beer is clearly part of an established range and available in supermarkets. All three I spotted carried badges indicating awards for craft beer, world beer and international competitions. Given my own rating, I am baffled.  |
