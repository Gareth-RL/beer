Comments: 'Bottle. Mestre Co-op. Poured reddish brown amber body tan lace top. Aroma
  has caramel malt and toast. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more toffee and
  some twiggy hop. Medium to light body slick feel average carbonation and a slightly
  metallic bitter finish. I always struggle to remember to review the corporate ales
  of Italy. This is one such and not the worst despite the gulf between the name and
  the experience '
