Comments: '"Bottle from the local coop Mestre. Unsurprised to see that the Bavarian
  raters were not impressed. Pours cloudy golden with white lace foam top. Aroma has
  some banana and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with not a lot
  to speak of. Palate is medium, tacky feel, soft carbonation and a light finish.
  It''s not bad but nor is it good."'
