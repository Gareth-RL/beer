Comments: I am having a supermarket sweep in Mestre (VE) and this was available at Ali. Poured hazy cloudy pale golden body, scummy lace top. Aroma of stale bread and banana with a hint of apricot. Medium sweet to lightly sour/bitter. Some stone fruit and bread cereals. Medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation (bottled) and a short bitter finish. One is glad that not all hefeweizen taste like this.
