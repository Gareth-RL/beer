Brewer: Coop Italia
City: '"Casalecchio Di Reno &#40;BO&#41;"'
Comments: Poured cloudy orange golden body white foam lace. Some esters to yield fruit
  in the scent and hints of spice but not a classic hefeweissen by any means. Medium
  sweet to bitter with cereal and spice notes. Medium bodied grainy texture average
  carbonation and a light spice finish. I am continuing my supermarket trawl and in
  that category this is not the worst but better are also available in most Italian
  supermarkets. Nice bottle though!
