| **Comments**  | Poured cloudy orange golden body white foam lace. Some esters to yield fruit in the scent and hints of spice but not a classic hefeweissen by any means. Medium sweet to bitter with cereal and spice notes. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a light spice finish. I am continuing my supermarket trawl and in that category this is not the worst but better are also available in most Italian supermarkets. Nice bottle though!                                                                                      |
