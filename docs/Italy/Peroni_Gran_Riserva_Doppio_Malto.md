| **Comments** | Aroma caramel malts. Pours golden with white top. Taste is sweet with sour alcohol finish and too much carbonation. It accompanied a meal which thankfully was far better. But then again I have always had an aversion to lager. 30/07/18 tried again in the absence of anything better and it remains a disappointment. |
