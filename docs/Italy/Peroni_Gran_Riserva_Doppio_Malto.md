Beer: Peroni Gran Riserva Doppio Malto
BeerID: 7976
Brewer: Birra Peroni (Asahi)
City: Roma
Comments: Aroma caramel malts. Pours golden with white top. Taste is sweet with sour
  alcohol finish and too much carbonation. It accompanied a meal which thankfully
  was far better. But then again I have always had an aversion to lager. 30/07/18
  tried again in the absence of anything better and it remains a disappointment.
