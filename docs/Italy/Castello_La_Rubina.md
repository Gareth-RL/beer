Comments: Bottle from the local supermarket in Mestre. Red brown body but the lacing is thin and fading . Medium sweet with light caramel malted taste. Not a lot to report here. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a fade rather than a finish. An unremarkable 6 5% ale 30/06/24 second sipping from a stash donated for Xmas.  Tastes slightly better.
