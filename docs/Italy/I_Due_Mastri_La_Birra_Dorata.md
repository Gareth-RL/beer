Comments: Poured hazy golden body white foam top.  Aroma of coriander and floral hops. Belgian like in scent. Medium sweet to bitter with a taste of stewed fruit with spice notes and a tart finish.  Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a tart sour finish.  hardly A classic golden ale in the American or English traditions but for anyone on an Italian supermarket sweep there are worse.
