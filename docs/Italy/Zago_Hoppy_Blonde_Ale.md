Comments: '"Poured golden body full white foam head. Aroma of biscuit malts and spicy
  citrus hops. Medium sweet to bitter with hop dominant flavour of tangerine and spices.
  Dry bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a dry bitter
  finish. Certainly worthy of it''s name. 01/01/25 second sipping after more than
  a year.  Another leftover from the cellar.  Still golden and hoppy. "'
