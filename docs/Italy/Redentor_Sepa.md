Comments: Aroma has roasted caramel coffee bean and dark chocolate and a light  licorice
  note. Pours dark with tan cream top. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Bought from
  a small cantina in piazza Santa Margarita. I was warned that it would not taste
  like Guinness. (a tribute to my red hair I assume). Thankfully this is true.
