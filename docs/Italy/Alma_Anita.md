Beer: Alma Anita
Brewer: Alma Birrificio Monzese
Aroma: 6.0
Appearance: 3.0
Taste: 7.0
Palate: 3.0
Overall: 14.0
MyScore: 3.3
Comments: Bottle from a pop-up street food festival in Parco Albanese, Mestre. Bought at the Bar Monzo. Pours a murky reddish brown with no head to speak of (quite a contrast from the Briganda which was largely foam). Aroma of malt loaf and stone fruit, maybe date. Medium sweet with a damson or date quality (odd, in short), but certainly a stone fruit, and certainly it is the antithesis of lager in the best altbier tradition. It's also labeled sticke which I thought may be associated with its strength but is unhelpfully the German for secret so not much clarity to be had. Medium bodied, softly carbonated, smooth texture, and a light bread finish with modest bitterness--a very subtle transition. On the positive side it conceals the alcohol very well: not a hint of burn and this could be a dangerous beer for a session. I am going to grade it generously overall since I really am not equipped to assess the Sticke Alt as a style and it is certainly better than the Porter from the same Alma birrificio. Autumnal, which is an odd beer to rate in Italy in July!
