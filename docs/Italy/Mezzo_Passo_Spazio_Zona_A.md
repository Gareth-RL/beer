| **Comments** | Bottle at Sullaluna bistro and bookshop in Venice. Poured Golden body off white thin lace. Aroma of citrus hops and pale malts. Taste medium sweet to bitter with more hops evident. Medium bodied, musty malt texture, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Overall, it is true to type and brewed and bottled for this bistro as their house beer. |
