City: '"Popoli &#40;PE&#41;"'
Comments: Bottle at Sullaluna bistro and bookshop in Venice. Poured Golden body off
  white thin lace. Aroma of citrus hops and pale malts. Taste medium sweet to bitter
  with more hops evident. Medium bodied, musty malt texture, average carbonation and
  a light bitter finish. Overall, it is true to type and brewed and bottled for this
  bistro as their house beer.
