Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Zago Hoppy Red Ale
BeerID: 857665
Brewer: Zago Birrificio Agricolo
City: '"Chions &#40;PN&#41;"'
Comments: Poured deep brown amber with pale beige cream foam top. Aroma has sweet
  berry hops and roasted malts.  Taste confirms its medium sweetness souring gently
  and smoothly to a bitter finish with a  rye bread tang. Palate is medium bodied
  smooth texture average to soft carbonation (well judged for a  bottled beer) and
  a long malt finish. My best Italian beer on this visit. 12/04/24 last tasted in
  2020 so worth a second sipping. I edged it up a notch on scent since the berry hops
  came through pleasantly, but my generosity only stretches so far and it is largely
  the beneficiary of some dreadful stuff I have had recently. 24/12/24 it was tucked
  away downstairs and in 4 months it has gone gassy and raisin scented
