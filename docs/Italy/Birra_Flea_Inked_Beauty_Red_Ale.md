Comments: '"Poured hazy amber with thin lace top. Aroma has roasted malt and berry
  fruits. Taste is lightly sweet to sour with fruit more evident in the sourness than
  in the sweetness. Tangy finish. Palate is medium bodied, grainy texture, average
  carbonation and a sour finish. Easy drinking in its own way although I don''t really
  enjoy the sour finish, and  the only thing about its international amber status
  that holds is a reddish hue.  I harbour a suspicion it may be a repackaging of an
  existing beer to showcase the Inked Beauty can art of Gianmarco Materazzi, which
  isn''t going to improve the beer! There is another Red ale and same abv."'
