Comments: Can from Ali. Poured a golden body with a white foam top. Grassy hops and
  pale malt scent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more pale malt and a little
  herbal spice in the finish. Medium to light bodied,  smooth texture, average carbonation,
  and a light bitter finish. A very standard commercial lager and nothing more.
