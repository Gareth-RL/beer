Comments: Poured golden body thin lace top.  Aroma of citrus floral hops -- melon and mandarin.  Medium sweet to bitter with grapefruit and papaya added to the fruit mix. Light to medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a bitter finish.  My second West Coast style IPA from an Italian craft brewery today and this one is a lot mellower.  Dangerously session worthy.
