| **Comments** | A collab beer with Unahop from Seregno. Pours a copper amber body with thin off-white lacing. The scent for me was more malty than hoppy with a jam on toast quality. Medium sweet with a fruit gum aspect briefly but this is quickly followed by a longer bitter note and a bit of heat in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation with a long bitter finish with just a little roughness from the alcohol. Badged as an English IPA but more accurately identified as a Double IPA here. This is the fourth or fifth Alma beer I have tried thanks to a street market nearby and they are a mixed bag with too many disappointments. I think DIPAs are a harder type to do well than Double Stouts or Porters but this one is marred by its harsh finish. |
