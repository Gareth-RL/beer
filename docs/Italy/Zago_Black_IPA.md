Comments: '"Beware my bottle initially yielded two-thirds of a glass of foam. Safely
  pouring a glass took 10 minutes. Body was dark chestnut with tan foam much of it
  transient. Aroma was roasted malts and lager hops.  Taste was medium sweet with
  a light bitter finish. Palate was medium bodied   over gassy, which interfered with
  the texture and taste. Maybe it''s better alla spina. 22/12/2023 this bottle was
  better behaved. Pours dark brown, almost black, body with full cream, tan top. Aroma
  of roasted dark malt with just a back-note of hops. Medium sweet to bitter with
  a little caramel and licorice along the way. Light to medium bodied, smooth texture,
  still slightly over-carbonated, and a bitter finish. I must try to find a different
  dark beer."'
