| **Comments** | Bottle Blip agrimercato. Pours dark hazy brown with broken tan top. Aroma has caramel toffee malts..  Taste is medium sweet, some light hop fruit bitterness. Palate is medium bodied,  sticky texture,  average carbonation,  and a warm alcohol finish.  Overall a good attempt at a style I would like to see more of. |
