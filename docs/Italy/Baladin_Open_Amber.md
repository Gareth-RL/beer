| **Comments** | Apr 13 2018 in Torino. Ruby colored beer. Nice malt aroma and agreeable taste. Medium bodied with a pleasant finish. Not bad at all. 21/12/24 bottle left over from summer. I liked it better second sipping.  Rich malt flavour.  I could do without the 7.5% abv, but heyho it's almost Xmas. |
