| **Comments** | Poured cloudy murky orange body some sediment foamy white top Aroma of tropical fruit and pine resins. Taste is medium sweet transition to bitter but more fruit in the finish. Palate is medium bodied grainy soft carbonation and a light finish. Docked .2 or so for heavy sediment. I expect it in Belgian bottles but not canned NEIPA. |
