| **Comments** | Bottle from One for the Road beer shop in Mestre. Pours predictably cloudy orange body with broken lace. Strong tropical fruit aroma with pineapple especially evident. Taste is medium sweet then sours to a final bitterness but dank fruits are dominant. Medium bodied, slightly grainy texture, average to soft carbonation, and a light chalky mineral finish. Overall, very true to type, and sufficient to make me think that a stop at the taproom in Nova Gorica would not be a waste of my time. |
