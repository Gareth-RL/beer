Beer: Lobik Speedoman
BeerID: 870405
Brewer: Lobik Craft Brewery
City: Ruše
Comments: Can from Birragogo Milan. Poured murky orange golden body with thin lace
  top. Aroma is dominated by pineapple and pine with other citrus in the background
  (standard NEIPA). Taste is briefly sweet and fruity but sours quickly into a grassy,
  herbal finish. My usual gripe with NEIPA is that they can leave a chalky mineral
  residue in the aftertaste, and this one is not immune but I have had worse! The
  only other Slovenian beer that I have ever tasted was a pretty dreadful cheap lager
  so this is definitely a step up!
