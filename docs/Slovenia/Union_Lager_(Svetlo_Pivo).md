Comments: '"19/07/19 A bottle offered in Croatia. Not much scent. Pours golden with
  white foam. Taste of sweet malts with a bitter finish. A lager at its most basic.
  16/07/22 It''s still available and I decided to give it a try to see if anything
  had changed. I omitted the palate last time around in terms of comment and it seems
  to be the overarching feature of all the lagers on this trip: they are gassy with
  an unpleasant or metallic aftertaste. Still the same score on the doors as I remain
  generous."'
