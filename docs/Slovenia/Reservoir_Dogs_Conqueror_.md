| **Comments** | Can from One for the Road Mestre. Poured orange golden body with loose broken white lacing. Aroma is citric with a light herbal hop backnote. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a smooth transition and the bitterness largely in the after taste since the fruit persists. Palate is medium to thin in body, smooth in texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. A very sessionable session IPA. |
