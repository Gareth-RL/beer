| **Comments** | Poured black body with dark tan lace. Aroma of chocolate coffee and cherry. Lightly sweet but mainly bitter as the chocolate is dark and the coffee is double espresso.  Medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a bitter finish.  Formidable but I was hoping for more from the Slovenian dogs. |
