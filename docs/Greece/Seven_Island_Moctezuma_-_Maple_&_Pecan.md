| **Comments** | Can. Certainly a different kind of Greek beer! Poured black body with diminishing tan cream top. Aroma has pecan and maple to be sure but also some chocolate and licorice notes. But the nuts predominate. Taste is emphatically sweet with the maple syrup more pronounced and the malts adding a toffee note or three. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, smooth feel, soft carbonation, and a mellow finish with the alcohol very well concealed (dangerously so if you drink the can solo). This is another instance where I think the high octane beers should come in smaller measures by default 440ml at 12% demands to be shared and present circumstances make that harder to ensure. While the beer is exactly what it declares a maple pecan dessert imperial, it is so firmly in the sweet camp that it lacks a little variety with no transition from sweet to bitter as is often sought. |
