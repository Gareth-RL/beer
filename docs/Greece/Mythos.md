Comments: 'Aroma has grainy lager malt and grassy hay hops.  Pours golden with white
  foam top. Taste is lightly bitter with a surrounding sweetness that is most evident
  in the finish.  Palate is medium bodied,  oily texture,  average carbonation,  and
  a sweet finish.  Overall it exceeded my low expectations. '
