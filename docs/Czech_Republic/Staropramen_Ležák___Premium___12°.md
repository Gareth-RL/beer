| **Comments** | Can. Poured golden with white foam. Little aroma beyond pale malts and maybe apple. Taste is medium sweet with pale malts dominant and just a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. Its boast of balanced taste is marketing soeak for bland . Medium bodied grainy texture over carbonated and a souring bitter finish. I thought a Czech lager might be an improvement but this is M-C so industrial brurgh.  |
