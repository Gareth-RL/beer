Comments: 'Poured golden body thin lace top.  Aroma of bread malt and paper. Medium
  sweet to bitter with a little nondescript fruit and a strong hint of cardboard.  Especially
  in the finish, and overall it is the harsh grainy texture that is its major flaw.
  Lidl purchase so cheap if not cheerful. '
