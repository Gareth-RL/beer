Comments: '"Bottle from street market in Trieste. DAFF seem to specialise in supplying
  Italian street markets. Pours dark brown almost black with thin tan lacing. Aroma
  of dark caramelised malt. A hint of hop fruit. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter with malt dominant throughout and the toffee. light roast coffee notes evident.
  Medium bodied, soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Hard to categorize:
  the label mentions stout but the website alludes to lager. Certain not super strong
  by the standards of craft beer at 7%, but a pleasant enough beer that could pass
  for American brown ale, English porter or German style Doppelbock; but where the
  original Prague styles appear is less clear"'
