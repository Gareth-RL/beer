| **Comments** | Bottle via Honest Brew because I thought at least try it even if lager is not my thing. Poured deep yellow body thin white lace. Aroma was modestly pale malted and grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some lingering malt in the hop finish. Palate is medium bodied, reasonably smooth, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. It's certainly more drinkable than many a lager I've encountered but it is not in any way memorable |
