Comments: 'Believe it or not this is a good score for a lager in my car. Poured reddish
  amber body tan lace. Aroma nutty malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some coffee
  malt some hop fruit and it lies on a Dunkel borderline for me. Medium bodied smooth
  texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. If it crops up in my travels this
  summer it may offer safety '
