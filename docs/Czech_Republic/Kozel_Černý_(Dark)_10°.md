Comments: '"Bottle from Aldi. Poured dark brown body thin diminishing lace. Malty
  scent, bready and lightly caramelized. Taste is medium sweet, largely lasting, with
  not much transition or variation so if you don''t like the first sip, quit now!
  As someone who likes a sweet malt, this may be the lager for me. Even the abv suits
  me these days. Palate is medium, mouthfeel is somewhere between oily and stick;
  what it is not is smooth or crisp. Average carbonation and lasting sweetness, not
  much sign of bitterness to be found. Although this will add to my slim Czech total,
  given the multi-national Asahi network, it is more global than central Bohemian."'
