| **Comments** | Aroma has very little frankly. Pours the regulation NEIPA cloudy yellow gold with white lace but doesn't deliver. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but on a lemon spectrum. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a chalky finish. Frankly given the brewers involved both stellar on occasion it is a big disappointment  |
