Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy yellow gold with white top.
  Aroma has a little fruit on the nose but the passionfruit in evident on the tongue.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average
  carbonation, and a languid finish. Not sure I could take a session of this: it stales.."'
