| **Comments** | Tap at Beeheadz Nottingham. Aroma has chocolate vanilla malts. Pours jet black with tan halo . Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter which doesn&#39;t capture the rich deep flavours that make this a stout to seek out. Palate is medium to full bodied smooth silky texture soft carbonation and a rich languorous boozy finish. |
