| **Comments** | Poured black body tan halo. Rich vanilla fudge nose. Cacao. Taste is full sweet coconut macaroons dipped in caramel. I guess there's a grainy coffee finish but this is for the sweet toothed. Palate is full bodied, there's a smoothness in the caramel but the aftertaste is grainy, carbonation soft to average and a long finish. As always, very well managed booziness. A beer to finish with. |
