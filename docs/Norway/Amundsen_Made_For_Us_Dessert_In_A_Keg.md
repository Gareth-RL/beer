Comments: '"Poured black body tan halo. Rich vanilla fudge nose. Cacao. Taste is full
  sweet coconut macaroons dipped in caramel. I guess there''s a grainy coffee finish
  but this is for the sweet toothed. Palate is full bodied, there''s a smoothness
  in the caramel but the aftertaste is grainy, carbonation soft to average and a long
  finish. As always, very well managed booziness. A beer to finish with."'
