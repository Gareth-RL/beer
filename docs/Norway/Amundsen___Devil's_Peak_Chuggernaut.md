BeerID: 549515
Brewer: Amundsen Bryggeri
City: Oslo
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy cloudy yellow with white lace.
  Aroma has tropical fruit and pale malts. Taste is medium bitter with spicy finish.
  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. Still
  pondering the merits of NEIPA, tasty enough but with a strong sense of the experimental
  and possibly unrepeatable.
