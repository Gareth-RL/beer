| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream top. Aroma is magnificent I could survive on the scent alone. Vanilla cake, coffee, chocolate, bourbon and toffee. Taste is above medium sweet in the same way that Donald Trump is above medium stupid and could deter some. Possibly not a beer to serve to the diabetic or undemocratic. Palate is remarkably smooth, medium bodied, silky texture, soft carbonation, and a sweet finish. The artistry here is in the Bourbon infusion it adds vanilla but doesn&#39;t add an alcohol burn. Stuff like this takes beer into places normally reserved for poets and visionaries. See you there. |
