Beer: Lervig House Party
BeerID: 606682
Brewer: Lervig
City: Stavanger
Comments: Aroma puzzled me. Something beyond citrus or spice that smacked of bubblegum.
  Taste was medium sweet to lightly bitter but with the artificial tang lingering
  like a wine gum. Palate was medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation
  and a light fruity finish. Not at all what I expected from a session IPA.
