| **Comments** | Aroma puzzled me. Something beyond citrus or spice that smacked of bubblegum. Taste was medium sweet to lightly bitter but with the artificial tang lingering like a wine gum. Palate was medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a light fruity finish. Not at all what I expected from a session IPA. |
