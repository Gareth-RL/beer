Brewer: Amundsen Bryggeri
City: Oslo
Comments: Poured orange body thin white halo. Tropical fruits hoppy nose. Pineapple
  grapefruit mandarin. Taste is predictably sweet to begin but resinous pine notes
  are quickly evident. Palate is medium bodied soft to average carbonation slightly
  cotton feel and a diminishing bitter finish. Certainly a hoppy DIPA but nothing
  outstanding.
