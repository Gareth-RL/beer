Beer: Amundsen / Dry & Bitter / Dugges Hop Magic
BeerID: 557229
Brewer: Amundsen Bryggeri
City: Oslo
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale gold with thin white lace top. Aroma
  is full of fruit - peach, tangerine, pineapple, guava, lemon and grapefruit - more
  than your five a day. Taste is less spectacular as its the medium sourness and bitterness
  of pith that come through from the hop concoction. Likewise the palate, medium bodied,
  average to soft carbonation, slick texture, and bitter finish. So excellent, I could
  smell it happily all evening.
