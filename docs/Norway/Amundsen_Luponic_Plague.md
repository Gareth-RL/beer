Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy orange golden body with off white lacing.
  Aroma is peach and pink grapefruit zest. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is
  medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a little bitter finish. Overall
  a pleasant enough NEIPA. The lazy brewer&#39;s preferred pale ale."'
