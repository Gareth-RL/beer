Comments: 'Bottle. Pours dark brown almost black with a foamy tan head that only slowly
  diminishes. Aroma is spruce, herbs, on the hop side and caramel, nuts, coffee, on
  the malt side and to find so much of both in the same beer is a measure of its complexity.
  Taste is medium sweet at least with some bitter treacle notes behind the caramel.
  Palate is medium to full, stickly texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long
  circuitous finish. Christmas came early this year, and that was partly because this
  discounted bottle is well past its sell-by date. '
