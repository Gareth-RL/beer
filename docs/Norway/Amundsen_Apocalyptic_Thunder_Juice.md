| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow pale with white top. Aroma citrus fruit and pale malts and oats. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, average to soft carbonation, and a  souring finish. The epitome of NEIPA but not the drink with which I would face apocalypse. My plan is to get the 4 horsemen drunk.... 21/09/21 second sipping. Lost a point for texture. |
