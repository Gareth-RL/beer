Beer: Amundsen / Northern Monk Voodoo Headbanger
BeerID: 640020
Brewer: Amundsen Bryggeri
City: Oslo
Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky orange with lace halo. Aroma
  is a hop fest. For me the resin and herbal hops overwhelmed the fruit. Taste is
  medium to full bitter with a souring finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture,
  soft carbonation, and a sour finish. Certainly hoppy but not a triumphant collaboration.
