| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream top. Aroma is richly nutted and toffee vanilla flavored with chocolate and coffee malt notes. Taste is initially very sweet indeed but then the alcohol kicks in to offset this. The palate is full to medium bodied , sticky texture, soft carbonation and an alcoholic finish like a spirit shot. Overall like most imperials with Bourbon, it is formidable but a third is more than enough. |
