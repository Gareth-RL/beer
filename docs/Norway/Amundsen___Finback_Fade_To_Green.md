| **Comments** | I have been impressed with Amundsen and I was ashamed to find that Finback had evaded me till now so this can is supposed to rectify that oversight. Peachy mango grapefruit hoppy scent. Pours the classic cloudy orange body with thin lace of the NEIPA. Taste is more bitter, pithy and grassy. So not the fruit bombs of some NEIPA. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation or above, and a piney bitter finish which I guess honors the title as it fades. Overall, I felt that I might need to try more Finback to pass judgment, and certainly this is not one of Amundsen's standouts. Just goes to show that a collaboration of excellent brewers does not guarantee excellent beer but rarely produced awful stuff. |
