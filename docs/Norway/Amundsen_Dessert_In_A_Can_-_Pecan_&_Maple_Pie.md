Comments: '"Not subtle. This is a dessert beer from the first whiff. Aroma has pecan
  nuts and a hint of praline, and that of course is the chocolate oozing through the
  dark malts and they also yield some cappuccino if you take it with maple syrup.
  Pours equally predictably black and tan. Taste is full on cake sweetness with only
  a hint of dark chocolate bitterness as your mind plays with the idea that instead
  of tasting maple syrup you are finding almond or even coconut. I was going to say
  it will drive you nuts, but I am trying to be sophisticated this year. Palate is
  full to medium bodied which deserves some praise as the scent and taste could easily
  describe a breakfast spread. That said the feel is sticky and there''s a hint that
  the sinews of this beer are stretched to restrain the alcohol burning below. Soft
  carbonation essentially and a long finish ( today is Monday and it might diminish
  Wednesday morning). There are people out there who should sample this and ask themselves
  if they really could not live with a Norwegian + solution to Brexit."'
