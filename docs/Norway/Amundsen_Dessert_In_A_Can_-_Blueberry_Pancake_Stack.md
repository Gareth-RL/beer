Comments: '"Poured black with diminishing thin tan loose lace top. Aroma is emphatically
  blueberry with chocolate cake malts. Taste is ultra sweet with berries still prominent
  and smooth chocolate pastry notes. Palate is full bodied, creamy feel, soft to average
  carbonation and a long rich finish. It is all the dessert I need. I love a rich
  sweet flavoured stout but can''t help wishing that this came in at 6.5 rather than
  10.5. Certainly the octane is skillfully glossed over with no after-burn of alcohol.
  One wonders how the Norwegians manage to drive home. "'
