Comments: '"Keg at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy pale gold with halo of white
  lace. Aroma has passionfruit and peaches with maybe a lychee swirl. Taste is medium
  sweet to sour with a salty smack finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture
  average to soft carbonation and the above mentioned salty ending. It&#39;s got to
  perk you up"'
