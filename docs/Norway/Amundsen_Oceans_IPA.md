Beer: Amundsen Oceans IPA
BeerID: 211222
Brewer: Amundsen Bryggeri
City: Oslo
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours amber if unclear with broken off white lacing.
  Aroma is grapefruit atop a malt toffee base. Taste is lightly sweet with a  vanilla
  twist and then light bitter with a modest pine note. Not textbook IPA but eminently
  drinkable. Palate is medium bodied at a push. Texture is sticky and carbonation
  average to soft. Finish is bitter but halfhearted. Good enough for the Arctic but
  a brave crew deserve even better.
