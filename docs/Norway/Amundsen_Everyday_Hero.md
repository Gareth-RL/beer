| **Comments** | Poured pale golden with white lace top. Bright citrus scent lemon grapefruit zest. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with drying finish. Some honeyed malt detected. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I thought it was going to be a lager so its IPA quality appealed. Can 2 of advent calendar ( I leave for non beer Xmas on December 17). |
