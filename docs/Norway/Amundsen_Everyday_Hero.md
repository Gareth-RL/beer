Comments: Poured pale golden with white lace top. Bright citrus scent lemon grapefruit
  zest. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with drying finish. Some honeyed malt
  detected. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. I thought it was going to be a lager so its IPA quality appealed. Can 2
