| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours dark brown with tan cream top. Aroma has indeed marshmallow of the sort found floating in chocolate. And a shimmer of Alcohol. Taste is intensely sweet like fun fair candy but what is impressive is the offset of the alcohol - no burn at all. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft carbonation and a long sweet finish &#40;you may need to see a dentist&#41;. |
