Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours yellow gold with white lace. Aroma is herbal
  orange floral hops. Taste is medium to more bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily
  texture, average to soft carbonation, and a lasting bitter finish. A solid IPA but
  I somehow say that begrudgingly. It&#39;s bitterness is infectious."'
