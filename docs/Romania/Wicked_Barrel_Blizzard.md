BeerID: 572121
Brewer: Wicked Barrel
City: Bicaz
Comments: Pours black bodied with thin tan halo. Aroma is richly malted with coffee,
  chocolate and ashy notes. Taste is similarly composed with  the coffee having that
  smoky edge that some roasts have and the final savour edging firmly into salted
  licorice. Palate is medium to full bodied with a smooth texture, soft to average
  carbonation and a long lavish finish. I strongly suspect this is my first Romanian
  beer and I can see from the other reviews that the locals clearly like it. As well
  they might. The alcohol is well concealed by the rich coffee flavours. There could
  be worse things than getting lost in this blizzard.
