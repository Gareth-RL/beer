| **Comments** | Poured cloudy pale yellow with little lace to speak of. Aroma has definite tea scent with a little lemon and vanilla. Taste is medium sweet transiting to sour with a light bitter finish. It certainly is not a classic in either sour or IPA categories. Texture is thin and watery with some oily mouthfeel and average to soft carbonation. If you fancied a beer that tasted of lemons and green tea, you made an excellent choice. |
