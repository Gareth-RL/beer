Appearance: 3.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Bereta / Hop Hooligans / Wicked Barrel Inbox (5)
BeerID: 866410
Brewer: Bereta Brewing Co.
City: Giarmata, Timiș
Comments: Poured cloudy pale yellow with little lace to speak of. Aroma has definite
  tea scent with a little lemon and vanilla. Taste is medium sweet transiting to sour
  with a light bitter finish. It certainly is not a classic in either sour or IPA
  categories. Texture is thin and watery with some oily mouthfeel and average to soft
  carbonation. If you fancied a beer that tasted of lemons and green tea, you made
  an excellent choice.
