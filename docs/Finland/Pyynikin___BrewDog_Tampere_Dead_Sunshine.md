Comments: '"Dark fruits and chocolate malts evident in the aroma. Pours black to brown
  with bubbly tan halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but within those poles a lot
  happens. There''s a rich earthy maltiness and a vanilla-esque sweet note. Palate
  is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish but there
  is some booze burn which for me is the test of a good Imperial - the smoother the
  better. So aroma is very good and taste excellent but palate is less so."'
