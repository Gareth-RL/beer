Comments: Tap at the Junkyard and one wonders why. Pours amber, thin lace halo. Aroma
  lightly floral hoppy. Taste is medium bitter to sour. Palate is medium to light,
  sticky texture average carbonation, and a sour finish. My sample was not as bad
  as those sampled in Finland but it could stay in the keg in most respects.
