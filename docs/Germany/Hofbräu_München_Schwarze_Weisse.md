| **Comments** | Bottle Ali supermarket Mestre. Poured brown body with full foam tan top. No lager straight glass to hand and the Belgian chalice filled with foam. Aroma has ripe banana caramel malt and yeast esters. Taste is medium sweet with more toffee banana. But there's too much fizz. Light to medium bodied but texture is marred by overcarbonation and slightly metallic finish. I am toying with the idea of sampling the standards from the supermarket since at 1.69 a bottle it's very affordable compared to 6-8 euros for the craft and the latter are hit-and-miss. |
