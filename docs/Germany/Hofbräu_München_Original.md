Beer: Hofbräu München Original
BeerID: 7531
Brewer: Staatliches Hofbräuhaus München
City: München
Comments: Poured clear golden body white lace top lasting. Aroma pale bread malt corn
  and grassy hops. Taste medium sweet to lightly bitter but with the kind of balance
  that yields blandness. Especially in the finish. I am persevering with my supermarket
  sweep of cheap standards. The issue here is my general misunderstanding of why lagers
  of the Helles type are so ubiquitous.
