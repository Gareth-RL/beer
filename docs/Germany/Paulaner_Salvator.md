Comments: 'Pours amber copper brown with white foam head.  Aroma of caramel malt with
  honey notes.  Taste is medium to full sweet to lightly bitter.  Palate is medium
  bodied,  sticky texture,  average carbonation,  and a light bitter hop fruit finish
  beneath the toffee malt. Very nice if a little monochrome. 16/08/23 second sipping
  at the bar of the residence in Bibbione where we are vacationing. It was either
  this or Ichnusa! Bottle was clearly for export since it used every language except
  German, and the beer was if anything less tasty than the first time. '
