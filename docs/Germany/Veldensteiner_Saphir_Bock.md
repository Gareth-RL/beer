Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Veldensteiner Saphir Bock
BeerID: 366994
Brewer: Kaiser Bräu
City: Neuhaus an der Pegnitz
Comments: Bottle. Poured reddish chestnut body with tan lacing. Aroma has sweet roasted
  malt notes-- caramel and a hint of vanilla and berry fruit. Taste is medium to full
  sweet which moderates rather than sours and just a hint of bitterness in the finish.
  Certainly a sweeter Doppelbock. Texture is light to medium bodied, smooth, soft
  carbonation despite the pop when the bottle opened, and a light spicing in the finish.
  Overall, very tasty; if it were not nearly 8% I would happily have a session.
