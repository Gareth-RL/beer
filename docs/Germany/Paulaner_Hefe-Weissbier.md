| **Comments** | Pours cloudy orange with full foam top. Classic yeasty banana spice scent. Taste also sweet and spicy with crisp bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to full carbonation and a crisp finish. Something of a classic and this is a belated review since it became staple beer for me during a hot Atlanta summer when a local bar had it on draft. So drinking it in Italy to celebrate proving for the second time in 4 days that I am negative for covid 19, and have not brought Boris's improved variant to spoil everyone's Christmas. Even so, the festivities in Italy this year will be muted. |
