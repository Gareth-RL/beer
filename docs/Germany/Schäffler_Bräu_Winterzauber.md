Comments: Poured amber body thin lace. Aroma is autumnal but more apple and pear than
  berry and plum. Medium sweet emphatically fruity.  Light bitter finish. Medium bodied
  smooth texture average carbonation (for bottles) and a light bitter finish eventually
  once the fruit subsided.  Intriguing add a new Bavarian brewery for me.
