Comments: 'Bottle. Pours light orange golden body with white lace top. Aroma has pale
  malt with definite citrus and grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter
  but lingering. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a
  lingering bitter finish. All fair enough but for a session IPA one surely ought
  to ask would you spend your night in its company and my answer is only reluctantly.
  I would want something with more character. '
