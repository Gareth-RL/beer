Comments: I didn't notice the 11% abv when I bought it at the local supermarket.  Aroma of autumnal and dark fruits. Malty. Poured reddish amber body thin lace.  Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more date and fig notes and a little alcohol in the finish.  Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish.  A mixed bag.
