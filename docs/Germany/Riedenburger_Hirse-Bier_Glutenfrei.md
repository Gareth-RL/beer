Beer: Riedenburger Hirse-Bier Glutenfrei
BeerID: 845491
Brewer: Riedenburger Brauhaus
City: Riedenburg
Comments: Bottle from Beers of Europe. Poured a cloudy murky pale yellow with thin
  lace. Odd scent grainy but also slightly aniseed. Taste is similarly peculiar being
  more bready than hoppy and with an aftertaste of stale sourdough. Watery and thin
  with average carbonation and a languor that I would happily wish away. Certainly
  not recommended. But then again, I am a philistine in the guise of an Englishman
