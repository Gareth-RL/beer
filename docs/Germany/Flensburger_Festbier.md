Comments: '"Surprised this has so few reviews although it''s not Bavarian festbier.
  Poured amber golden body thin white lace top mostly diminishing. Aroma bread malt
  and stewed fruit. Taste medium sweet to bitter light toffee and spice in the finish.
  Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Gassy
  on draft so watch the bottles. The more I think on it, the less generous I feel
  so this may be too kind "'
