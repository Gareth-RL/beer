| **Comments** | It seems to suit the UK raters. Better than the Scandinavian ones. Aroma is dark licorice malts deep roasted. Pours black with decent tan lace. Taste is medium sweet but this transitions quickly to bitter with aniseed herbal notes along the way; if there's coffee it's licquered. Palate is medium bodied, and the salt for me lightened the texture and gave the soft carbonation a fizz. Pondering the finish, I guess there light caramel. So the boys from Berlin did good! |
