Comments: '"Poured golden body with thin lace.  Aroma has pale malts and grassy hops.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a clean crisp bitter finish in the true Pils
  style. Palate is medium to light bodied with grainy texture, average carbonation
  and the said bitter finish. I am trying to boost my modest experience of German
  beer and I guess Oktoberfest will extend it further if I take up the delivery offers.
  This seems a lager in the classic mold: a style that has been endlessly copied and
  is highly influential here Italy. So if I know the original then I can assess the
  imitators, although I doubt it will overcome my resolute indifference to lager."'
