Beer: Tegernseer Dunkel Export
BeerID: 16952
Brewer: Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee
City: Tegernsee
Comments: Aroma of caramel malts, and grainy bread. Pours deep reddish amber with
  thin tan lace . Taste is medium sweet with a sweet malts edge and light bitter finish.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long mellow finish.
  I bought it for the style and I can imagine that if I could frequent the brauhaus,
  this would be a regular choice.
