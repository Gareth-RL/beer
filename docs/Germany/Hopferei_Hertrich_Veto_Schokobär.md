Brewer: Hopferei Hertrich
City: Feucht
Comments: Bottle from Beerhawk. Pours dark brown with red tint and fizzy off white
  lace top. Aroma has caramel, light coffee and roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture and a light lingering
  bitter finish. I had never tried a German stout and this makes me suspect that they
  are better with hops.
