| **Comments** | Bottle from Beerhawk. Pours dark brown with red tint and fizzy off white lace top. Aroma has caramel, light coffee and roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture and a light lingering bitter finish. I had never tried a German stout and this makes me suspect that they are better with hops. |
