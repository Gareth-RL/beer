| **Comments** | I like it. Malty nose with definite roasted cereal note. Pours amber with broken spotted lacing. Toffee malts contribute medium sweet but there's some light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Obviously I need to go to Germany Autumn rather than summer.  |
