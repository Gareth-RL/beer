| **Comments** | Bottle from the local supermarket. Poured clear golden with rapidly diminishing white lace top that leaves barely a halo. Not a lot to the scent: a hint of malt and maybe a smidgen of hop but aroma is certainly not its thing.Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but again it is a fine line between balance and blandness. Palate is medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, average to soft carbonation and a lingering bread finish. Tbf, it wasn't chilled and that may make all the difference to the character boasted about by the marketeers, but it is a beer that sharply divides the cognoscenti. Some of RB's connoisseurs, albeit in their younger days, have been fans. I am none of the above: connoisseur; young; or fan. |
