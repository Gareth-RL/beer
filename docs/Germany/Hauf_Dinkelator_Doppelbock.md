| **Comments** | Pours dark reddish brown body, thin rapidly fading lace top. Aroma is malty, nutty, lightly caramelised. Taste is medium sweet to slightly sour with a hint of spice in the finish. Palate is medium bodied with some dustiness in the texture, average carbonation and a spicy finish.I think I am being drawn to the Doppelbock more and more during my enforced European sojourn; it seems to suit me more than the Belgian yeasty beers. Bottle bought from BirraGoGo. I was unaware of the beer's seasonality when I placed the order in May, and what does it mean Nov-Feb when the bottles have a sell by Nov 21 deadline? 22 June second sipping despite the heat. Still very much to my taste. |
