Comments: '"Pours dark reddish brown body, thin rapidly fading lace top. Aroma is
  malty, nutty, lightly caramelised. Taste is medium sweet to slightly sour with a
  hint of spice in the finish. Palate is medium bodied with some dustiness in the
  texture, average carbonation and a spicy finish.I think I am being drawn to the
  Doppelbock more and more during my enforced European sojourn; it seems to suit me
  more than the Belgian yeasty beers. Bottle bought from BirraGoGo. I was unaware
  of the beer''s seasonality when I placed the order in May, and what does it mean
  Nov-Feb when the bottles have a sell by Nov 21 deadline? 22 June second sipping
  despite the heat. Still very much to my taste."'
