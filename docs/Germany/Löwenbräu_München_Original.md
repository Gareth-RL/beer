Comments: I continue my stroll along the supermarket beer aisle and find this familiar name, which I have never reviewed. It's lager but you never know until you try. Pours a golden body with loose white foam lace top. Aroma is of grassy hop and bread malt. Medium sweet to bitter with a slight spice note and a drying finish, but bland as hell.Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation (can 500 ml), and a dry finish. A small step from here to Fosters frankly.
