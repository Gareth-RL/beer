| **Comments**  | Widely available at low cost in supermarkets in southern Europe and equally widely judged meh. I don't disagree. Stewed scent. Cloudy murky appearance, broken lace top.  Taste is medium bitter with metallic finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average+ carbonation and metallic aftertaste. Don't be tempted                                                                                       |
