Comments: Can from a supermarket in Bibione, a resort east of Venice. Poured pale gold with thin lace. Aroma of dry grassy hop and metal. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a crisp dry herbal finish, Obviously the Germans and northern Europeans are scathing in much the same way we condescend to the megabrew bitters in the UK but it did not lower my already low opinion of lager. Light to medium bodied, smooth but fizzy, and a crisp finish. And I will add that the day was hot.
