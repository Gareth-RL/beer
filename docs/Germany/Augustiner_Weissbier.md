Comments: I am beginning to suspect that, like their wine, the Germans keep the best beer for home consumption. Certainly this bottle from an Italian supermarket seems less tasty than others have found on draft in Germany.  Yeasty malty nose.  Banana toffee taste but ultimately it leaves a sour taste. Medium to full bodied heavy carbonation and a sour finish. Not the refreshment I was hoping for .
