Comments: I am beginning to suspect that, like their wine, the Germans keep the best
  beer for home consumption. Certainly this bottle from an Italian supermarket seems
  less tasty than others have found on draft in Germany.  Yeasty malty nose.  Banana
  toffee taste but ultimately it leaves a sour taste. Medium to full bodied heavy
  carbonation and a sour finish. Not the refreshment I was hoping for .
