Comments: '"Poured murky golden body with white foam top.  Aroma has bready malt and
  grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet with a drying sourbread finish. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a sticky dry finish.  It''s okay but
  there''s something underwhelming about it. "'
