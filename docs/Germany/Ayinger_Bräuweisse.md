| **Comments** | Tap  at the Canal House. Pours cloudy pale gold with thin white broken lace. Aroma is indeed floral, herbal and spicy with a definite yeasty scent. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium body, slick, fizzy, lively carbonation, but I don&#39;t know if I would describe the finish as either long or abrupt. One is left tingling. |
