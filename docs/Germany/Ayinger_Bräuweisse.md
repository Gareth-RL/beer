Comments: '"Tap  at the Canal House. Pours cloudy pale gold with thin white broken
  lace. Aroma is indeed floral, herbal and spicy with a definite yeasty scent. Taste
  is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium body, slick, fizzy, lively carbonation,
  but I don&#39;t know if I would describe the finish as either long or abrupt. One
  is left tingling."'
