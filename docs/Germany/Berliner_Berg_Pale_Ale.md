Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Berliner Berg Pale Ale
BeerID: 372388
Brewer: Berliner Berg Brauerei
City: Berlin
Comments: Bottle. Aroma has lemony citrus hop and maybe a hint of cooked vegetables.
  Pours slightly hazy, yellow pale body with a diminishing lace top. Taste is medium
  biscuit sweet to bitter with a light sour tang at the end. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture, soft to average carbonation and a light sour finish. Personally I
  feel this is evidence that the Americans should make pale ale and the Germans should
  make pilsener.
