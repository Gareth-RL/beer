Comments: '"Bottle from Aldi Mestre. Poured hazy brown gold with thin off white lace
  diminishing. Aroma has some citrus hops. Taste is lightly sweet to sour; not a lot
  happening really. Palate is light to medium bodied, a little graininess, soft carbonation,
  and a bitter sour finish. This bottle was apparently produced in Gualdo Tadino which
  is near Perugia in Umbria and was then bottled in Verona. Either way, it''s forgettable
  stuff. 16/08/2024 second sipping.  So forgettable I buy it again in 2024. Much depends
  on your tolerance for grapefruit pith. Mine seems greater but it is a low bar to
  average these days."'
