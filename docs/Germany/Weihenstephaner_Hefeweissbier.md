| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours golden with white lacing. Aroma has the promised banana and vanilla for me. So yeast ripens a banana. Taste is medium sweet to lightly nothing if lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation, and a soft sticky finish of no great consequence. Dimly  I recall this tasting better on hit days in the American South. On cold evenings in the east Midlands it's not the same. 22/02/23 the same as before 30/09/24 ditto |
