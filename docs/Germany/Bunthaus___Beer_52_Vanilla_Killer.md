Comments: '"Bottle from Beer52. Pours a good amber golden colour with white foam top.
  Aroma is odd&#045;&#045;but I guess that is Tonka and its increased use is interesting
  given concern over its toxicity for the liver&#033; But it is supposed to enhance
  vanilla flavours which it failed to do here. Taste is medium bitter and lightly
  sweet at the end. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and
  a slight sweet almond finish. Overall a beer that looks better than it tastes. "'
