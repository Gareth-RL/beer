Comments: '"Keg. A find. Aroma richly malty with molasses and toffee notes. Pours
  brown with ruby lights and off -white top. Little lacing. Taste is delicious with
  a blend of sweet malts and bitter hops and that elusive Smokey finish. Maybe Doppelbock
  will eventually displace Porter as my favourite beer &#40; a move might be required.&#41;"'
