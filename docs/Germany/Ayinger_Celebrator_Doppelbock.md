| **Comments** | Keg. A find. Aroma richly malty with molasses and toffee notes. Pours brown with ruby lights and off -white top. Little lacing. Taste is delicious with a blend of sweet malts and bitter hops and that elusive Smokey finish. Maybe Doppelbock will eventually displace Porter as my favourite beer &#40; a move might be required.&#41; |
