Comments: 'A beach beer. Poured pale gold white lace. Little scent, maybe a hint of
  lemon and grass. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more citrus fruit. Palate
  is medium crisp average carbonation and a bitter finish. Refreshing lager, but no
  more than that. Still alla spina at a beach kiosk ... '
