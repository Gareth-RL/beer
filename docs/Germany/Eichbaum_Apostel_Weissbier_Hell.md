Beer: Eichbaum Apostel Weissbier Hell
BeerID: 715504
Brewer: Privatbrauerei Eichbaum Mannheim
City: Mannheim
Comments: Can from Prix supermarket in Mestre Venezia as part of my supermarket sweep.
  Pours hazy golden body full foam top. Aroma of bread malt and banana yeast. Medium
  sweet to lightly bitter, a little banana and a spice finish. Light to medium bodied,
  smooth texture, full carbonation, and a dusty spice finish. I appear to be the first
  UK based reviewer to have rated this well travelled beer and I can see why it underwhelms
  so many. Hardly a compelling advertisement for German brewing despite the nice logo
  but it was 0.89 a can.
