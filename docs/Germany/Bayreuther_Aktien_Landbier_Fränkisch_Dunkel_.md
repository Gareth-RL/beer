Comments: Bottle from Beers of Europe. Poured chestnut body off white lace. Aroma of roasted malt and earthy straw hops. Medium sweet to bitter with a little toffee malt along the way and a light bitter finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation for a bottled beer and a bitter finish. I would happily drink it but would not rate it among my top Dunkel lagers.
