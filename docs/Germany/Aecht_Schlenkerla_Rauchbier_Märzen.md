Comments: To state the obvious: don't drink this if you do not like smoked beer. It's very much a classic of that style. Pours dark brown with thin tan lacing. Aroma is malty and (you guessed) smoky: bacon and ash to be more precise. The taste is medium sweet to bitter but overlaid with rashers of the bacon cooked over an open fire. Medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation and a smoky if lightly bitter finish. Easy to find internationally these days, but I suspect it tastes better in Germany, although the biggest RB fans are Scandinavian. It is a classic.
