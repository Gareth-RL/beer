| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan foam lace top. Aroma of dark malt loaf and raisins. Medium sweet to bitter with some treacle toffee in the foreground and a hint of alcohol in the finish but no burn. Medium bodied smooth texture and a slightly spiced bitter finish. A tasty doppelbock and it's a shame that it is 7.8% and 500ml; these days I only manage thirds. |
