Comments: '"Bottle from One For the Road bottle shop Mestre. Still trying to find
  my lager in a world full of Pils. This one pours nicely: golden body, clear with
  loose foam white top. Aroma is modest: just a little pale malt. Taste is lightly
  sweet to bitter with a definite biscuit bread malt finish. Palate is medium bodied,
  smooth texture but with a definite crispness in the transition to an intensifying
  bitter finish. Certainly an afternoon/evening in the right beer-garden in Bavaria
  could be spent agreeably in its company. In some respects, it parallels the qualities
  of English bitters that are on the mark in terms of type but hardly stellar in any
  particular attribute. Certainly, few would rave about its aroma; and only the discerning
  could dissect the taste; and it would take a connoisseur to blind-taste the difference
  in texture. But it is good. Maybe that is enough."'
