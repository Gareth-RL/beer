| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours murky pale orange with quite definite lace top. Aroma is fruity peach pineapple mango orange a bit of a punch. Taste is more mellow and medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied with sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a long finish. Another beer that left me mellow as opposed to enthused. Maybe beer cannot substitute for life &#40;as the brew name indicates&#41;. |
