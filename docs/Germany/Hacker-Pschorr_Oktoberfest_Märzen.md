| **Comments** | Bottle to mark Oktoberfest. Pours amber body off white lacing. Aroma of malt loaf. Taste is medium sweet with caramelised malts dominant but some spicy hop to the bitter finish. Palate is medium to light in body, reasonably smooth in the transition, average carbonation, and a spicy bitter finish that may reflect the yeast. I know that Marzen is more my kind of German beer and this is a good example without ever hinting at a wow factor. In passing I don't see too many rave reviews from Germany, although it find fans in America. Some however in the Pays Bas in particular don't like it! It is good enough for me. 29/10/22 still good enough  |
