Comments: '"Probably one of the best smoked ales I have had. Aroma of cedarwood kippers.
  Pours dark mahogany brown body tan lace top.  Medium sweet to ashy bitter with some
  nice toffee malt along the way.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a smoky finish. Shame it''s keg and therefore cold and I am too impatient to
  let it warm"'
