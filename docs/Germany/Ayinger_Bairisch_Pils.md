| **Comments**  | On tap at One for the Road and recommended by the two Germans who were already there. Pours a pale body with white lace. Pale malt aroma. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with a nice balance between pale malt and grassy hops. Light to medium body, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a crisp bitter finish. Definitely lager.                                                                                      |
