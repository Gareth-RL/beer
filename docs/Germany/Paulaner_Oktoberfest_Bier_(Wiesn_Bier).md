Comments: '"Tap @The Canal House Nottingham. Pours pale yellow gold with lasting white
  lace. Aroma floral hops honeyed malt. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate
  medium bodied, slick feel, soft to average carbonation and a sweet honey finish.
  Easy drinking and should be more available in the UK than it is. 23/09/23 second
  sipping 5 years later. Still one of my favourite lagers."'
