Comments: '"poured ruby chestnut body with tan lacing. Aroma has roasted malt and
  herbal hop. Taste is medium sweet with some fruit and a pleasant bread malt finish.
  Palate is medium, slightly grainy texture, especially in the finish, average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. Overall, this confirms that if I ever get to Munich''s Oktoberfest
  (which I judge unlikely), I would seek out the Dunkel."'
