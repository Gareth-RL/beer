| **Comments** | poured ruby chestnut body with tan lacing. Aroma has roasted malt and herbal hop. Taste is medium sweet with some fruit and a pleasant bread malt finish. Palate is medium, slightly grainy texture, especially in the finish, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall, this confirms that if I ever get to Munich's Oktoberfest (which I judge unlikely), I would seek out the Dunkel. |
