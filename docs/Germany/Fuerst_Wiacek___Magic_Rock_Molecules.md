| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours orange juice with cloudy body and little foam. Aroma has mango and floral hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter coming in early. Palate is medium bodied with a clammy chalky feel, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Tasty enough but the look and the feel are a contrast for me. |
