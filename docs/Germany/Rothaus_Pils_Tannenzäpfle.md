Beer: Rothaus Pils Tannenzäpfle
BeerID: 9599
Brewer: Badische Staatsbrauerei Rothaus
City: Grafenhausen
Comments: Bottle. Aroma is more sweet hay and cereal malt but with a hint of piney
  hops. Pours clear pale golden body with thin diminishing lacing. Taste is medium
  sweet with a little crisp bitterness in the background. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily textured, average carbonation, and a light crisp finish. Overall, as I try
  German lagers, I discover lagers that I can drink rather than the stuff that just
  gives you gas.
