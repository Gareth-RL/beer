Comments: 'The yeasty wheat banana scent is coupled to some dark malts. Poured murky
  brown with foaming off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with
  a little souring in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, soft to average
  carbonation and a yeasty finish. Possibly better bottled. '
