| **Comments** | The yeasty wheat banana scent is coupled to some dark malts. Poured murky brown with foaming off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a little souring in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, soft to average carbonation and a yeasty finish. Possibly better bottled.  |
