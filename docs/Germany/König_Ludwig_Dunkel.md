| **Comments** | Poured reddish brown body, creamy tan lacing mostly lasting. Aroma has some dark malt but more bread than caramel. Taste is medium sweet with some spice notes in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Overall, it seemed pretty true to type but not especially distinctive. Once again, I am struck by the gulf between the scores of the Scandinavian raters who are mostly unimpressed (scores below 3.0) and American scores that are often above 3.5. Perhaps damning is the absence of a really positive review by a German rater, and the Brits are split but rarely enthused. I joined the latter chorus. |
