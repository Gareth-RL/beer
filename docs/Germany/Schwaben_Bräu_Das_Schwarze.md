| **Comments** | Pours clear brown body with ruby lights and a thin tan lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and sweet hops.  Taste is medium sweet with roasted malts dominant with a hoppy finish. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  This is my first German scharzbier and it is okay rather than superior to foreign imitators. The most exciting thing may be the pop when you spring the top. That's seldom a good sign. |
