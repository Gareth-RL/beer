Comments: '"Pours clear brown body with ruby lights and a thin tan lacing. Aroma is
  roasted malts and sweet hops.  Taste is medium sweet with roasted malts dominant
  with a hoppy finish. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish.  This is my first German scharzbier and it is okay rather
  than superior to foreign imitators. The most exciting thing may be the pop when
  you spring the top. That''s seldom a good sign."'
