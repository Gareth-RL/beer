| **Comments** | Can. Aroma: there is certainly spruce but the mango eludes me. Appearance is clouded toffee and this is slightly off-putting like a beer that is drunk too soon. Taste had caramel malts, piney hops and a background fruitiness that is mildly gooseberry. Palate is medium creamy, the finish is soft and the carbonation is flat. Overall, this remained a puzzle to me as I am not really a Gose drinker and the sourness that I have associated with the style is very muted here. Recommended by the waiter and a more expensive option &#40;You live and learn&#41;. |
