Comments: '"Bottle. Pours [perhaps because it&#39;s me pouring] clear chestnut body
  with little to no head to speak of. Aroma is pleasingly caramel and roasty malts.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture I guess
  although not excessively so, soft to average carbonation, and a languorous malty
  finish. It was probably the palate that pushed it above average for me. If it crosses
  my path again, it will be an easy choice."'
