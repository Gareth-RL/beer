| **Comments** | 33ml can. I am still working my way through cheap German lagers at the supermarket in a Venetia-Friuli beach resort. Golden body full foam head. Aroma of grassy straw hops and pale malt. Medium sweet to bitter with a definite straw and metallic quality (I won't knowingly buy this again). Medium bodied, metallic coating in the mouth, gassy and a sour finish. I don't like lager at the best of times, but this is the kind of beer that gives Pilsner a bad name. |
