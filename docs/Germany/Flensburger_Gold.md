| **Comments** | Bottle.  Pours golden with diminishing white lace top.  Aroma has light caramel malts and grassy citrus hops.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter.  Palate is light to medium bodied oily texture,  average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Given how little I like lager, it's good to taste a good one |
