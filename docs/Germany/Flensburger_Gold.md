Comments: '"Bottle.  Pours golden with diminishing white lace top.  Aroma has light
  caramel malts and grassy citrus hops.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter.  Palate
  is light to medium bodied oily texture,  average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Given
  how little I like lager, it''s good to taste a good one"'
