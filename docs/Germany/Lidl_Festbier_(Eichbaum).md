Comments: '"Lidl can. Poured pale amber with surprisingly little lacing and that faded
  fast. Aroma of nutty malt and vegetable stock. Taste is medium sweet, a little caramel
  detected. Not much of a finish. Medium bodied, clammy texture, fully carbonated,
  and bready finish. It doesn''t convey Oktoberfest to me."'
