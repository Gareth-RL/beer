Comments: 'Much depends on how much you like Kolsch. Pours clear golden body thin
  white lace.  Aroma of grassy hops and pale malts.  Medium sweet to bitter with sweetness
  from the malt balances by slightly sour grassy notes from the hops. Light body,
  crisp feel accentuated by carbonation in the bottle version at least. A malty finish.  As
  I am not a German lager fan, it is not likely to excite. '
