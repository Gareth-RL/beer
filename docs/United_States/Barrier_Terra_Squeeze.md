| **Comments** | Pours murky pale orange with a prodigious amount of foam that does die back eventually to something that one can drink through. The hopfest is evident in the scent with citrus especially grapefruit tangerine and lime and some pine notes. Taste is moderately sweet initially but this transitions to a more definite and lasting bitterness with an NEIPA style chalky quality in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, lively carbonation, and a sharp bitter finish. /overall a decent NEIPA but it could do with less foam. |
