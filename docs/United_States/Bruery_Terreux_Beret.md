| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours amber with white lace halo &#40;first sign of difference - most sours I have encountered are less full in colour&#41;. There&#39;s more in the aroma than my poor olfactory function can deal with. Fruit and toffee apple in a sour? Taste is medium sweet to sour but there&#39;s a pregnant pause before the sour truly arrives. Palate is also heavier than most sours being the top edge of medium bodied, richly textured, average carbonation, and a long and languidly souring finish. The more I had, the more I liked. |
