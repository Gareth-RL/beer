| **Comments** | Listed as Hornindal Kviek Pale Ale. Styled after a Belgian pale but with Norwegian yeast. A little lemon and spice on the nose. Pours clear copper body and thin lace. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Tasted a bit like an English ESB to me. |
