| **Comments** | Aroma has pineapples mango and the regular medley. Pours murky with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Lots of fruit still edging towards candied. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a light but long bitter finish. Surprisingly this is the pick of the flight - just in case Ground Control is interested  |
