Comments: 'Aroma has pineapples mango and the regular medley. Pours murky with thin
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Lots of fruit still edging towards
  candied. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a
  light but long bitter finish. Surprisingly this is the pick of the flight - just
  in case Ground Control is interested '
