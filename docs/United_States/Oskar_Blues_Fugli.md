| **Comments** | Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours amber gold body and white lace top. Aroma has a medley of fruits tropical and subtropical, raw and cooked. Taste is medium to light sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation, and a long finish. Might help if I had previously encountered a Yuzu. Uncommon in these parts. |
