Comments: '"Tap at Todd English Birmingham Al. Aroma has sweet sugar malts and floral
  hops. Pours amber gold with thin white lace. Taste is medium to full sweet and a
  light bitter finish &#40;that is the honey for you&#41;. Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish with honey notes.
  Overall a smooth drinking brown ale."'
