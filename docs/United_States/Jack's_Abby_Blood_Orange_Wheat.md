Comments: '"Can at the Park bar Cambridge. Pours orange gold with thin lace halo.
  A little bit of citrus floral scent atop the wheat nose but good rather than great
  in aromatic terms. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some cereal notes. And blood
  orange rather orange.  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and
  a bitter finish.  There''s a sense that this might be anniversary experiment that
  did not triumph even though it certainly didn''t fail. "'
