Brewer: '"Lawson&#39;s Finest Liquids"'
City: Waitsfield
Comments: Tap. Pours golden and clear with bubbly lace top. Aroma is hay, floral,
  grass, dough, citrus, but only in review. On casual encounter this is a hoppy beer.
  Initially taste is one of medium sweetness, but bitter sour notes build. Body is
  medium and texture is sticky. Carbonation is average to lively with a bitter finish.
  A refreshing session IPA.
