| **Comments** | Tap. Pours golden and clear with bubbly lace top. Aroma is hay, floral, grass, dough, citrus, but only in review. On casual encounter this is a hoppy beer. Initially taste is one of medium sweetness, but bitter sour notes build. Body is medium and texture is sticky. Carbonation is average to lively with a bitter finish. A refreshing session IPA. |
