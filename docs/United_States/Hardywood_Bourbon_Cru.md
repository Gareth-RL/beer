| **Comments** | Aroma has booze bourbon caramel malts. Pours rich amber treacle toffee body with tan halo. Taste is in the same vein - toffee sweetness and a backburn of alcohol. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. I do hope it's good for colds! |
