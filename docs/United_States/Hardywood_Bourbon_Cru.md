Comments: '"Aroma has booze bourbon caramel malts. Pours rich amber treacle toffee
  body with tan halo. Taste is in the same vein - toffee sweetness and a backburn
  of alcohol. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation
  and a long finish. I do hope it''s good for colds!"'
