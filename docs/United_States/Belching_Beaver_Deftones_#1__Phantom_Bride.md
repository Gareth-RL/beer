| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy yellow with white lace. Aroma is tropical fruit and grapefruit fruit with the latter winning. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Satisfying without ever threatening more. |
