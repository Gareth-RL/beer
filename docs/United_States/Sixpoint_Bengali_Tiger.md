| **Comments** | Can. Aroma pale malts and hop oils. Some citrus. Pours orange amber with white top and broken lacing. Taste is medium to light sweet and medium to strong bitter with a crisp finish. Medium bodied with slightly oily texture . A worthwhile IPA 6/03/20 second sipping. Still decent if oddly more expensive in America. |
