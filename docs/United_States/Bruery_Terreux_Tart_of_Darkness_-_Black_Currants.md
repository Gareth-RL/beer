| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours purple with pinkish foam lacing. Aroma is definitely currants with a jammy profuseness. Taste is medium to full sour but with enough fruit to guide you smoothly down the path. Palate is also medium bodied, slick, average carbonation, and a long sour finish. Vitamin C anyone? |
