Comments: '"Cask. Aroma grapefruit zest. Golden with thin lace top that coats the
  side. Tastes vibrant and richly hoppy with sweet fruity notes and alingering grassy
  zing. For those of us of a certain age, it’s like your first taste of Carlsberg
  special. The same warning signals&#033; But it’s a bit too gassy and overall retains
  the character of a bottled beer, even on draft."'
