| **Comments** | Tap at Todd English PUB Birmingham. Aroma is lightly hopped. Pours very hazy gold brown with off-white lace top. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sour. Palate is medium to light body, oily texture, average carbonation and a soft finish. No challenger to German brewers but I can imagine a summer day in Alabama when this fitted the bill. |
