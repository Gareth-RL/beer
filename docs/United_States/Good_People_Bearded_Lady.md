Beer: Good People Bearded Lady
BeerID: 175714
Brewer: Good People Brewing Company
City: Birmingham
Comments: Tap at Todd English PUB Birmingham. Aroma is lightly hopped. Pours very
  hazy gold brown with off-white lace top. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sour.
  Palate is medium to light body, oily texture, average carbonation and a soft finish.
  No challenger to German brewers but I can imagine a summer day in Alabama when this
  fitted the bill.
