| **Comments** | On sale for just Â£4.00 per 2/3. Not usual for a 12.6% import. But it was the Junkyard's 5th birthday so maybe they cut a deal. But clearly available elsewhere. Pours copper amber body thin lace. Aroma has a tannic note. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a buzzing fruitiness that suggests more than it delivers, like a seer with a stammer. Not like any old ale I have had and I fear this is more Heineken than Lagunitas. |
