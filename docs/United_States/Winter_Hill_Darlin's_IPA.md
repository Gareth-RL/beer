| **Comments** | Tried at the Park restaurant bar near Harvard. Pours a rich amber with a white halo. Aroma has toffee malt but with a sour note that is off-putting. Taste is medium sweet to sour, with toffee evident throughout which for me is unusual in an IPA. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall it improves after the initial inhalation. |
