| **Comments** | Poured black with dissipating tan foam head. Aroma is its chief charm being precisely what you would expect maple syrup to the fore alongside coffee and milk chocolate. By comparison its lack of a decent lace head lost it a point for me. Taste is profoundly sweet, beyond most candy bars in sweetness which does rather get in the way of tasting other things. I assumed there would be some maple syrup in the taste bit there's a lot more sugar like the caramel in a candy bar. I guess this overcomes the potential alcohol heat. Mouthfeel is sticky and full with light carbonation and a hint of bitterness in the very end but this is a sweet, hyper-sweet beer that may serve as a symbol of why breakfast in America can be bad for your health. |
