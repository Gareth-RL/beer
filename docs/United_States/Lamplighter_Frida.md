| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate malt coffee and spice note. Pours cola black with tan lace halo. Taste is medium sweet with a light chocolate bitter background. Not as spicy as I expected/feared. Palate is medium to full body smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a spicy finish. The more I drank the more I liked. |
