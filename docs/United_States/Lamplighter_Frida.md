Comments: Aroma has chocolate malt coffee and spice note. Pours cola black with tan
  lace halo. Taste is medium sweet with a light chocolate bitter background. Not as
  spicy as I expected/feared. Palate is medium to full body smooth texture soft to
  average carbonation and a spicy finish. The more I drank the more I liked.
