Comments: '"Tap @ Brewdog Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream top. Definite spice
  scent amid dark chocolate malts. Palate is medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation,
  and a light spice finish. Taste is sweet medium to full with a spicy note but not
  the usual chili one, thank goodness. Mantra seem to have the sweet stout down."'
