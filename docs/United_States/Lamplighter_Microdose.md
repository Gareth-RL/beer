| **Comments** | A session IPA that is as cloudy as a NEIPA. A little fruit and herbal hops in the nose but mainly pale malts. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. It wouldn't be my choice for a session, but then again, those are getting rarer. Still, they're other pales are superior to this one.  |
