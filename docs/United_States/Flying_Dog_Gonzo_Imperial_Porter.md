Comments: Bottle. Poured dark brown thin tan lace. Aroma coffee malt. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter. Some dark chocolate but mainly coffee. Palate is medium bodied,
  smooth texture, soft carbonation, and a long long bitter finish that does not die.
  Certainly intense and malty. I hesitated as this bottle got hidden in my cellar
  and when rediscovered I saw with dismay a July 2022 BBD. So maybe better if drunk
  in timely fashion
