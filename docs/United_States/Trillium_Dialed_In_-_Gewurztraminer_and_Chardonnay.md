| **Comments** | Tap at Bay 34. Pours like orange juice with a lace halo. Aroma has citrus hop with maybe a muted grape note. Taste is medium sweet or more with a light sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth feel which is impressive, average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall I can sense the skill of moving up the abv as smoothly as a Ferrari accelerates but it still is too sweet and one-dimensional for me. |
