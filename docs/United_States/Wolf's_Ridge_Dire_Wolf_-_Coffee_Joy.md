Comments: '"Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Lets bring some English realism to proceedings
  dominated by American euphoria. Aroma is vanilla cacao nibs and somethin close to
  marshmallows but not especially coffee like. Pours regulation black with dark tan
  halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter and here there''s coffee although whether
  it is a single sourced bean I neither know nor care. Palate is medium bodied, creamy
  texture soft to average carbonation and a long and largely sweet finish.  The world
  is ready for this. It''s a decent imperial stout but not an exceptional one. Fir
  those, visit Michigan or Norway."'
