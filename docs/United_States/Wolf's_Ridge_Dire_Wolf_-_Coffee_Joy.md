| **Comments** | Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Lets bring some English realism to proceedings dominated by American euphoria. Aroma is vanilla cacao nibs and somethin close to marshmallows but not especially coffee like. Pours regulation black with dark tan halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter and here there's coffee although whether it is a single sourced bean I neither know nor care. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture soft to average carbonation and a long and largely sweet finish.  The world is ready for this. It's a decent imperial stout but not an exceptional one. Fir those, visit Michigan or Norway. |
