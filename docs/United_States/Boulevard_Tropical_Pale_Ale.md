| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma has citrus hops on the grapefruit pith end of the spectrum but the rest of the juice band was muted. Pours dark clear orange amber with minimal lacing. While it fizzles initially on the tongue the taste is medium bitter and sour. Especially sour in the finish which lingers like stale air in a lift. Maybe I should have sent it back to KC MO. Disappointing. |
