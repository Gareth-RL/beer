Beer: Smuttynose Robust Porter
BeerID: 5576
Brewer: Smuttynose Brewing Company
City: Hampton
Comments: Bottle. Pours black with thin tan top, minimum lacing. Surprisingly little
  in the way of scent, grassy perhaps, despite the peat black colour. But the taste
  is excellent and has a crispness and lightness on the palate that may convert some
  who are not generally drawn to the dark side.
