Beer: Latitude 42 Island Fever
BeerID: 238128
Brewer: Latitude 42 Brewing Company
City: Portage
Comments: Tap at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan foam top diminishing.
  Aroma has toasted coconut vanilla and caramel malt hints of coffee and chocolate.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is low medium bodied for an imperial stout
  albeit a milk one, and by the same token the texture is more milk than cream. Carbonation
  average and a long finish. Tasty even if the coconut had an artificial flavour.
