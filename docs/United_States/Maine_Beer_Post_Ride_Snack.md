| **Comments** | @Boston  City Tap.  Pours golden thin lace top.  Aroma has mango, grapefruit hop and pale malt.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a biscuit bitter note at the end.  Palate is medium bodied,  oily textures average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Fine, but limited in my view. |
