| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma coffee, chocolate, caramel, nuts, raisin, and of course the Bourbon. Pours dark with a thin tan circle atop. The sweet vanilla fruitcake burst is a little overpowering but it seems a nice way to conclude this portion of my US trip. I can see why imperial stouts dominate the ratings and equally why they are beers realistically taken on their own. A festive tipple. After these 10oz, nothing further could cope. |
