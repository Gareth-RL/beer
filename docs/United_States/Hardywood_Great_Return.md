Comments: Tap at the Canal House. Aroma peach grapefruit citrus and floral hops. Pale
  malts. Pours amber gold with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with
  some caramel back notes. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average
  carbonation, and long finish. Good enough IPA with some very American aspects.
