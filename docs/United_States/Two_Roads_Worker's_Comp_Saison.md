| **Comments** | Tried at the Park Cambridge MA. On draft. Pours hazy light brown to orange body with off-white lace halo. Aroma is fascinating with toffee malt but plenty of hop fruit too. Taste is medium sweet to light bitter and it may be too sweet for some. Palate is again a plus in that some saison can be a little insipid whereas this is medium bodied or more, with a sticky feel, average carbonation and that light bitter, but still toffee finish. Overall I have enjoyed few Saison more. |
