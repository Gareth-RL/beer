| **Comments** | There's some coconut in the soft malty nose. Pours rich amber with ruby tint. Thin lace. Taste is medium to full sweetness with a light bitter finish. Not much vanilla for a BBA save a sweet boost.. Palate is silky smooth as you like with not a hint of the 13% you are ingesting (parental advisory). Not the best of their range by a margin, but hey.... |
