| **Comments** | Aroma of pale malts and berries. Appearance is amber body white lace but floating berries as a gimmick. Taste is medium sweet to bitter . Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A refreshing and unremarkable pale except for the floating fruit. |
