BeerID: 118028
Brewer: Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV)

Comments: Grainy herbal nose. Poured light golden amber body with thin lace top. Taste
  is grapefruit pith and bread grainy. So the sweetness is folded between bitter and
  sour flavours. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and
  a bitter finish. Decent.
