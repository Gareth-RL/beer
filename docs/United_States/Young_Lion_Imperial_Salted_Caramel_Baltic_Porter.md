Comments: '"Poured black body tan cream lace. Aroma of caramel and vanilla malts.
  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter plenty of caramel but a little bitterness
  in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light
  bitter finish. Shame it''s a 8.5 abv, a third was plenty for me"'
