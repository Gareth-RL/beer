| **Comments** | Poured black body tan cream lace. Aroma of caramel and vanilla malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter plenty of caramel but a little bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. Shame it's a 8.5 abv, a third was plenty for me |
