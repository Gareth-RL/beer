| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Gervase Warren. Pours ruby chestnut brown with lace top. Aroma of dark fruits and citrus back notes. Taste of spicy malts and rich fruits. Reminds me of barley wines of bygone days. It took awhile to track this down given Evil Twins NY provenance and Hereticâ€™s Californian one. But it sums up the American dilemma &#40;great taste but too much abv&#41;. I guess I could come in and have one of these and then go home. But life is more than that. |
