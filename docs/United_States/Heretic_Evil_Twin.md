Comments: '"Cask at the Sir John Gervase Warren. Pours ruby chestnut brown with lace
  top. Aroma of dark fruits and citrus back notes. Taste of spicy malts and rich fruits.
  Reminds me of barley wines of bygone days. It took awhile to track this down given
  Evil Twins NY provenance and Heretic’s Californian one. But it sums up the American
  dilemma &#40;great taste but too much abv&#41;. I guess I could come in and have
  one of these and then go home. But life is more than that."'
