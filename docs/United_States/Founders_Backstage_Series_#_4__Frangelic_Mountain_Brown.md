| **Comments** | Aroma is key and this is a brown ale for those who like their hazelnut cappuccino. Roasted hazelnuts and cocoa notes. Pours chestnut body with tan creamy lacing. Taste is medium+ sweet with the hazelnuts nestling in cream. What bitterness there is, is of the dark chocolate variety. So too sweet for some. Palate is rich medium creamy, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Too indulgent in some ways and just right in others. |
