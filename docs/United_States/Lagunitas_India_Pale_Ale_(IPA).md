| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma grapefruit zest and soiled straw. Pours orange golden with white froth unless your hand &#40;like mine&#41; is slow and steady. Crisp and sharp on the tongue the flavours are medium sour but the texture is more modest. For all the hype of 43 hop types and 65 malts, this is an IPA that will not form the basis for an evening out. It could disturbingly keep you in. Good but no cigar. |
