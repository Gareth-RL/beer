| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black body thin tan broken lacing. Aroma has coffee vanilla roasted malts dark fruit and the merest whiff of coconut. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium to full bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, long finish. As an 11% impy it has room to do more in terms of layers of flavours and even scent. So not top flight in its class. |
