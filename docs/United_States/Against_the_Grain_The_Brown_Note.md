| **Comments** | Tap. Pours brown body off white lace top. Aroma malty roasted toasted and plain. Taste is medium bitter sour bitter. Palate is medium and never full bodied even if the texture is sticky and the carbonation average. I took against this as I read the commercial description which is relentlessly hyperbolic and finally xenophobic. Brits do not unanimously favour monarchy, in fact Americans seem more interested than most intelligent Brits. But objectively it&#39;s a decent brown ale. |
