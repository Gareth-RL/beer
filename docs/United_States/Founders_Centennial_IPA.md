Comments: '"Can &#40;Lord help us&#41;.335ml. Aroma of pink grapefruit, even allowing
  for my pouring technique it’s citrus and floral in the same way that walking through
  the perfume section of a department store is floral. So even without the encomium
  of the judges, it’s a recognizable beer. In the end I achieved a respectable glass
  with an amber body good white top. Taste is equally distinctive. The hoppy character
  of the IPA is is emphatically there but I agree with the marketeers that the malts
  quotient is ever present. British IPA brewers take note."'
