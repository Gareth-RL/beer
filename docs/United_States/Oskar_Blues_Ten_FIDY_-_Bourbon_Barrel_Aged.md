Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham and largely because I had not had an imperial
  in a while and my stats showed a curious low average for Colorado &#40;this alleviated
  both&#41;. This is a treat for the nose the bourbon brings vanilla and treacly qualities
  to a stout that is already rich with caramel chocolate and licorice and booze. It
  pours emphatically dark and has an enticingly creamy tan top. The taste is medium
  sweet and what is perhaps most impressive is how the burn of 12.9% abv has been
  suppressed. The transition is to a dark chocolate bitterness. The palate is medium
  to full bodied with a smooth creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, and a
  languid bitter finish. Overall, it is a worthy &quot;end of the evening&quot; ceremonial
  heavyweight. I believe someone once said &quot;All hail to the ale&quot; and this
  imperial deserves the salutation."'
