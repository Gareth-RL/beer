| **Comments** | Aroma of dark caramelized malt, with a whiff of booziness. Pours dark brown with tan lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but there's a fortified wine backnote. Palate is medium sweet but the hop bitterness kicks in quickly - a bit like a rabbit-punch. Overall I think robust porter covers it. |
