Comments: '"Tap at the Brew Dog. Aroma was malted &#40;although my assessment was
  affected by the smell of burned pizza coming from the kitchen&#41;. Pours dark brown
  with ruby lights. Taste medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture, average carbonation, long finish. Ordered as part of a  completely
  unscientific examination of US interest in brown ale. Finding so far, Newcastle
  Brown has a big market."'
