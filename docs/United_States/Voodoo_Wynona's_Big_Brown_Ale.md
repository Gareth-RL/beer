| **Comments** | Tap at the Brew Dog. Aroma was malted &#40;although my assessment was affected by the smell of burned pizza coming from the kitchen&#41;. Pours dark brown with ruby lights. Taste medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, long finish. Ordered as part of a  completely unscientific examination of US interest in brown ale. Finding so far, Newcastle Brown has a big market. |
