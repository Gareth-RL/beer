| **Comments** | Poured pale hazy straw body with foam top. Aroma of citrus - lemon/lime/ and pine. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Understated for a NEIPA. Palate is light to medium bodied with average carbonation and a light bitter finish. What it does well is maintain a light freshness without the over emphasis on juice common to NEIPA and without the chalky finish |
