| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House on Jan 13 which presumably means festive consumption in the US and metropolitan areas was insufficient. Aroma is spicy although for me it did not meet the dizzy heights of Jamaican ginger cake. The cinnamon that Americans pour like salt got in the way. There was some dark fruit, although not enough to match a Lancastrian mother&#39;s fruit cake  &#40;what could?&#41; Taste is spicy but at least medium sweet since any sourness in this comes from within my friend. Palate is medium bodied so the lighter side of stout, texture is in no way related to velvet &#40;and that is a feel few forget&#41;. Carbonation average and finish like Harry Kane&#39;s both decisive and cherished. Overall this rating is in the spirit of Christmas which as any dog or drinker will tell you is not just for Christmas. |
