Brewer: Cigar City Brewing (Monster Beverage Corp)
City: Tampa
Comments: Can. Aroma is tropical in abundance with lychees, pineapple and mandarin
  somewhere in there. It pours a hazy orange and if you follow the can instructions
  you even a broken lace top . Taste has sufficient malts to offset the hoppy splendor
  but it remains an IPA of distinction, even if modern shipping places it in a can.
