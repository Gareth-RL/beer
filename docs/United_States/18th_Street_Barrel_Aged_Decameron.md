Comments: '"Poured reddish brown body, brown tan lace halo. Aroma has rich toffee
  malt with raisin notes. Taste reflects its barrel ageing. Vanilla, smooth caramel
  so medium sweet or higher with a little bitter chocolate in the finish and some
  candy marshmallow in the background. So a sweet beast. Palate is full bodied, sticky
  texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long malty complex finish with well
  tempered heat for the abv.  I wish I had a bottle I could take a nip from since
  its pleasures are immediate but they don''t really grow with further drinking,"'
