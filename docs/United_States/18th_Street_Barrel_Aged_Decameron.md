| **Comments** | Poured reddish brown body, brown tan lace halo. Aroma has rich toffee malt with raisin notes. Taste reflects its barrel ageing. Vanilla, smooth caramel so medium sweet or higher with a little bitter chocolate in the finish and some candy marshmallow in the background. So a sweet beast. Palate is full bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long malty complex finish with well tempered heat for the abv.  I wish I had a bottle I could take a nip from since its pleasures are immediate but they don't really grow with further drinking, |
