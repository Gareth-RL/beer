Comments: '"Can @ Doctors Orders. Pours black with tan cream top.. Aroma has dark
  malts with some citrus and pine hops peeping through. Taste is lightly sweet, medium
  bitter and very smooth. Palate medium to light, soft to average carbonation &#40;a
  can after all&#41;, finish is slightly sweet and the feel is oily. Overall a very
  pleasant IPA in an equally pleasant micro pub that could have tumble grass blowing
  through, it&#39;s so quiet for Saturday afternoon."'
