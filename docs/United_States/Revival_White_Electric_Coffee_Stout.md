Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Revival White Electric Coffee Stout
BeerID: 295263
Brewer: Revival Brewing Company
City: Providence
Comments: Tap. Aroma has the promised coffee and chocolate notes but not overwhelmingly.
  Colour is a cloudy dark brown with tan cream top. The taste has predictably sweet
  flavours that overstay their welcome a little. Carbonation medium to lively. And
  while the finish on the palate is bitter it is not smoothly managed - like an extra
  strong mint at the end of a meal
