Comments: '"Aroma of caramel malts and berry hops. Poured clear amber body with thin
  lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a lasting maltiness. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Brewed in memory
  of the late Monty Python great a man remembered either as Brian''s mother or associated
  with the phrase just a wafer thin mint. This is far more mellow."'
