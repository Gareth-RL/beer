| **Comments** | Aroma of caramel malts and berry hops. Poured clear amber body with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a lasting maltiness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Brewed in memory of the late Monty Python great a man remembered either as Brian's mother or associated with the phrase just a wafer thin mint. This is far more mellow. |
