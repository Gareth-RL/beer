| **Comments** | Poured cola brown with no head at all just occasional bubbles on the side. Aroma has the milk chocolate scent that you'd expect from Hershey's. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter, more cocoa and light lactose. Not much hop can get through. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. It's a chocolate porter, for sure, but not a stand-out example. |
