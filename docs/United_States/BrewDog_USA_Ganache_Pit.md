| **Comments** | Poured black body with tan cream lace. Strong aroma of cherry liquor and chocolate. Taste confirms medium to full sweet with chocolate to the fore but cherry lasting as the taste pleasantly sours. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a sour finish after a long delay.  I liked it more than I expected |
