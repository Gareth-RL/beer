| **Comments** | The newly designed label complete with skyline for those of us who do not know what urban means, speaks of a hazy straw colored beer with a light lemon aroma. By holding it up to the light, I can see the straw but no matter what I do the haze is gone &#40;may I report a theft&#41; and my lemons taste better than this.The aroma had edged towards banana &#40;probably because it had an expiration date in November&#41; and I have become intrigued by the single area of active fermentation as if just one spot in the glass is in the jacuzzi. I am confident therefore that this may well fulfill the promise above that it is unlike any other Goose Island beer. Again that is a promise that can be read both ways. One can rest assured that the others are better. Taste is meh, palate is blah, overall I can only hope that the after-effects are limited |
