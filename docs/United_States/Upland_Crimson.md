Comments: '"Muted cherry nose with some  light acidic notes. Edging towards claret.
  Pours a reddish amber body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter and the abv is well buried. Is this the ageing effect? Otherwise it''s missing.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light sour finish.
  Certainly a smooth 10%er. Suffered by being listed here alongside Oak & Red. Higher
  octane. More lavish description but ultimately less impressive."'
