Comments: '"Tap @Todd English Birmingham AL. If you like the smell of caramel toffee
  this malty brown will touch your inner praline. Pours reddish brown amber with creamy
  off white almost light tan top. As with every beer on this American trip I wonder
  what it tastes like at room temperature rather than chilled. It&#39;s a full sweet
  flavour which salt accentuates. A little sourness in the finish. Palate is medium
  bodied, creamy texture average carbonation and a sweet caramel butterscotch finish
  with just a hint of sour. It does edge towards drinking toffee sauce but there&#39;s
  worse things you can do with your mouth. Ask the president."'
