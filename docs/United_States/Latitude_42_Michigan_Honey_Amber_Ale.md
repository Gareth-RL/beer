Comments: '"It&#39;s a measure &#40;not sure what of&#41; of the world we live in
  that I&#39;m the first person to review a tap version of a Michigan beer. Pours
  a definite honey amber with a white lace top &#40;that took a while to settle as
  it was a fresh keg&#41;. Aroma has floral fruity hops and a honey note atop toasted
  bread malts. Taste is smooth medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky
  texture, average carbonation, and a long bitter finish. Even without the magnificent
  contributions of the bee communities of the Wolverine State, this is a very good
  amber ale. And it&#39;s not a vogue style. "'
