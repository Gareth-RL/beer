| **Comments** | Aroma has coconut atop pale malts. Pours golden with no head to speak of. Taste is medium sweet thanks to the background coconut. Palate is medium bodied creamy texture average carbonation and a lightly bitter finish. I am not really familiar with cream ale but this does what it says on the tin. |
