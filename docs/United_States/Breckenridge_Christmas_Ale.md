Comments: Poured clear copper amber body with thin lace top. Aroma has roasted malts
  with light coffee caramel notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some hints
  of chocolate and coffee but not a lot for a winter ale. Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel average carbonation and a slightly chalky bitter finish. Not impressed.
