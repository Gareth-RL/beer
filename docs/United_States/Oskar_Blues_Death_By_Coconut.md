| **Comments** | At The Junkyard Nottingham. Aroma is the promised coconut and cocoa. Pours dark although this is accentuated by the dimmed lighting at the venue. Tan lace halo. Taste is medium to full sweet with caramel notes so a dessert beer at the polar extreme from bitterness. Palate is medium to full bodied creamy texture and a long coconut finish. A third is heaven and several pints could be Hell. |
