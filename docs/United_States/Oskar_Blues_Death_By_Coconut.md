Beer: Oskar Blues Death By Coconut
BeerID: 261714
Brewer: Oskar Blues Brewery (Monster Beverage Corp)
City: Longmont
Comments: At The Junkyard Nottingham. Aroma is the promised coconut and cocoa. Pours
  dark although this is accentuated by the dimmed lighting at the venue. Tan lace
  halo. Taste is medium to full sweet with caramel notes so a dessert beer at the
  polar extreme from bitterness. Palate is medium to full bodied creamy texture and
  a long coconut finish. A third is heaven and several pints could be Hell.
