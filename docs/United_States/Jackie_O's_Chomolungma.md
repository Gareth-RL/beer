Brewer: '"Jackie O&#39;s Pub & Brewery"'
City: Athens
Comments: Nutty dark malt scent. Pours black body with creamy tan lace diminishing.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with nut and licorice notes.  Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Probably my favourite
  of their beer which initially I sample as a homage to the later great JBKO. Second
  sip confirms my opinion.
