Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange with off white lace top.
  Aroma is exactly what it says dry citrus hops with plum. This can produce an orange
  juice and toothpaste moment. That said, taste is medium sour with a fruity sweet
  background. Palate is medium bodied in an American sense, sticky feel, average carbonation,
  and a finish that is sour before it vanished. There are worse plum sour beers out
  there I believe.
