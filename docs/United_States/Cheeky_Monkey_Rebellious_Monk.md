Brewer: Cheeky Monkey Brewing Company
City: Boston
Comments: Roasted malts aroma. Poured dark ruby chestnut with scummy lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter with definite licorice tang. Dry finish. Palate is medium
  bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a dry finish. I expect more lace and
  body for a stout but this is a decent dry porter.
