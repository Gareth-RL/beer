| **Comments** | Roasted malts aroma. Poured dark ruby chestnut with scummy lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with definite licorice tang. Dry finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a dry finish. I expect more lace and body for a stout but this is a decent dry porter. |
