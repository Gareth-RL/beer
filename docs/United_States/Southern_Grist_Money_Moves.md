| **Comments** | Pours cola brown body and thin dissipating tan foam top. Aroma is  more emphatically nutty than syrupy. Taste is full sweet with enough peanut to satisfy Jimmy Carter and a fig leaf of maple. Some chocolate malt and vanilla also in the mix with a languorous finish. Palate is more medium than full, texture is largely smooth with just a little residual graininess, average carbonation and a long finish. I wish I could have drunk this in Nashville rather than Nottingham but still glad that Neon Raptor traded some cans for US beers. |
