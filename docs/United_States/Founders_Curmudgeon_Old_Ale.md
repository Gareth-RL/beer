Beer: Founders Curmudgeon Old Ale
BeerID: 40543
Brewer: Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel)
City: Grand Rapids
Comments: Bottle. Aroma rich caramel, vanilla oak and spiced dark fruits. A potent
  beginning for a dark amber ale with thin broken lace top. The taste is perilously
  close to barley wine in my view. Densely dark sugared and fruit packed. A fruitcake
  in a glass but wonderfully smooth. I suspect it’s an ale that is drunk solo and
  not simply because of its 9.8% kick. There’s a lot left on the palate un terms of
  malty complexity. It is getting a high rating from me but also a health warning.
  Probably the best thing to come out of Grand Rapids since MSU’s first class.
