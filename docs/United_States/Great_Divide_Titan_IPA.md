| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours clear golden pale with thin lace top. Aroma has spruce, resin, hops and toasted malts. Taste is richly malted with light toffee notes. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a very decent IPA  |
