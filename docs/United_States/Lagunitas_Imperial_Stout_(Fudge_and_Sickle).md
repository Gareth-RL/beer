| **Comments** | Don't you hate it when the new website eats a finished review?!  Pours dark with tan top. Aroma has vanilla fudge and tobacco leaf. Taste is full sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. An imperial worth the name. |
