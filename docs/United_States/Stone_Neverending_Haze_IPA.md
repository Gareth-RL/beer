| **Comments** | Can. Yes it does indeed pour hazy murky amber body with off white foam top. Aroma has grapefruit zest and pine resin and a touch of mango. Taste is medium sweet with a sherbet edge transitioning to a medium bitterness with a bit of a mineral tone. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Easier to digest than some NEIPA and at an octane that makes it sessionable. Surprised it seems to have missed the UK market but that may explain its high scores! |
