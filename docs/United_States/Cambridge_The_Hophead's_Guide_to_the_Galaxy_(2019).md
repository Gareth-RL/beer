| **Comments** | Aroma has the proverbial tropical fruit medley of pineapples mango papaya and citrus. Pours an equally customary cloudy funky yellow gold. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with the hop overload boosted by an oaten texture. Palate is medium bodied smooth rather than oily soft carbonation and a sour finish. Overall it fits firmly in the New England quadrant of the galaxy. And this leaves a lot of galaxy unexplored. Good! |
