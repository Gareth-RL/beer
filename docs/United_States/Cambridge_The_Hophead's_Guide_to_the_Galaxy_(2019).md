BeerID: 726657
Brewer: Cambridge Brewing Company (Castle Island Brewing)
City: Cambridge
Comments: Aroma has the proverbial tropical fruit medley of pineapples mango papaya
  and citrus. Pours an equally customary cloudy funky yellow gold. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly sour with the hop overload boosted by an oaten texture. Palate
  is medium bodied smooth rather than oily soft carbonation and a sour finish. Overall
  it fits firmly in the New England quadrant of the galaxy. And this leaves a lot
  of galaxy unexplored. Good!
