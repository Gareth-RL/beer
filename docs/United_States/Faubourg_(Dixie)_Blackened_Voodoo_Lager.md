Brewer: Faubourg Brewing (Made By The Water)
City: New Orleans
Comments: Tap at Todd English in Birmingham Alabama. Aroma has roasted malts and Cascade
  hops. Pours brown amber body with off-white lacing. Taste is medium bitter with
  some sweet malts in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation
  and a odd herbal finish. I doubt the Germans would approve.
