| **Comments** | Tap at Todd English in Birmingham Alabama. Aroma has roasted malts and Cascade hops. Pours brown amber body with off-white lacing. Taste is medium bitter with some sweet malts in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a odd herbal finish. I doubt the Germans would approve. |
