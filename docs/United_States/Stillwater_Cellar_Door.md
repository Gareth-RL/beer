Beer: Stillwater Cellar Door
BeerID: 123299
Brewer: Stillwater Artisanal
City: Rochester
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog. Pours hazy orange gold with thin white lace.  Aroma is
  herbs, principally sage which can indelicately head towards cat pee. Taste is medium
  sour to sweet then sour again. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to
  fizzy carbonation, and a soft bitter linger. Good but could have been better the
  sage addition largely obliterates the citrus hops. Overall I  had a higher score
  that got cut back.
