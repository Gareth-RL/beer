| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours hazy orange gold with thin white lace.  Aroma is herbs, principally sage which can indelicately head towards cat pee. Taste is medium sour to sweet then sour again. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to fizzy carbonation, and a soft bitter linger. Good but could have been better the sage addition largely obliterates the citrus hops. Overall I  had a higher score that got cut back. |
