Brewer: Trillium Brewing Company
City: Boston
Comments: Poured murky golden amber with lace halo. Aroma has some malt amidst a citric
  hoppy mix. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a NEIPA style chalky finish. Palate
  is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation bitter finish. Belies its
  reputation.
