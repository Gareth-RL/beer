Brewer: Two Roads Brewing Company
City: Stratford
Comments: Tap at the Canal House Nottingham. Aroma has the inevitable milky citrus
  nose. Pours yellow bodied with white lace top. Taste is medium sour with fruity
  sweet notes. Palate is medium bodied,sticky feel, average carbonation, and a sour
  finish. Still not sure if I will ever say, let us go for a night of pints of Gose.
  But this is well crafted.
