| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House Nottingham. Aroma has the inevitable milky citrus nose. Pours yellow bodied with white lace top. Taste is medium sour with fruity sweet notes. Palate is medium bodied,sticky feel, average carbonation, and a sour finish. Still not sure if I will ever say, let us go for a night of pints of Gose. But this is well crafted. |
