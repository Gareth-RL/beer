Comments: '"Tap. Aroma - one could say subtle if grass straw and citrus can be so
  described when experienced thinly. Pours yellow with a white top &#40;I believe
  that has been achieved before.&#41; Tastes of tart fruit as intended but the essence
  of the effect is at the end; the prelude is much more self-effacing. You may detect
  that seeing this priced at £8.50 a pint in a Nottingham pub is having a stronger
  impact than the 4.5% Gose style beer itself. But there was a time when beer was
  for barbarians, unpretentiously."'
