| **Comments** | Aroma is grassy herbal hop besides which the malts pale. Pours a cloudy pale lemon to orange - if it were a urine sample, the horse would not run. But the taste is well what one expects. Of Zwickel lager, that is; my knowledge only stretches so far. It speaks of a crisp bitterness with some light sweetness lest sourness intrudes. A beer for summer, then. And so to the palate: light to medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation and a crisp finish. So the lager serves the house well enough until the true Franconians arrive  |
