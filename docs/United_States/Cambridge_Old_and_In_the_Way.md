Comments: '"Bourbon ageing typically ads vanilla and heightens the toffee malt elements.
  I don''t know the original mild, but it was not a good candidate. There''s some
  caramel In the aroma but no vanilla. Pours dark brown with tan lace. Taste is medium
  to full sweet with a softening but no great contrast. Palate is medium to full bodied,
  sticky feel slightly but not as much as expected. Carbonation stronger and I have
  to conclude that the brewers decided it was otherwise too sweet. So the dream of
  an imperial Mild remains a myth "'
