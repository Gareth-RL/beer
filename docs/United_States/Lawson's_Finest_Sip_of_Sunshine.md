| **Comments** | Aroma has peach and citrus hops with roasted malts. Pours clear golden with white lace diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with plenty of smooth malts to balance the hop and it's very easy drinking for the abv.  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A very good DIPA. |
