| **Comments** | Tap @ Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours dark amber with white lace top. Aroma has soft caramel and cereal notes. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a soft lingering finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, and long finish. Good without ever threatening greatness. |
