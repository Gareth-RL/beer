| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours hazy golden amber with thin lace. Aroma has pithy citrus and herbal notes. Taste is medium sweet sour with a bitter edgy finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation and a crisp finish. This rating is brought to you by some one who wants the Saison Wild craze to abate. Enough already... |
