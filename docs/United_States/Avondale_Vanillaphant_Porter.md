Comments: '"Tap @Todd English PUB Birmingham. Aroma has coffee malts and vanilla notes.
  Pours brown cola with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with
  a vanilla finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture average carbonation and
  a bitter finish. Overall the best local beer so far on this Alabama trip, but even
  it has weaknesses in terms of the blending of flavours and these are heightened
  by the chilled serving of U.S. bars."'
