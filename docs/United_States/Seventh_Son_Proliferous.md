| **Comments** | Keg at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours a rich amber gold with white lace top. Aroma is subtly and balanced in one view or muted citrus and roasted malts on the other. Perhaps an imperial should make a choice? Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a soft landing on the malt side. Good enough but a chasm away from great. |
