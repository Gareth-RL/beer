Comments: '"Can from Kraftwerk, Nottingham. Pours copper orange body with halo. Aromas
  has spicy caramel quality so I guess that is the nutmeg and cinnamon and vanilla
  accounted for. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour although the sweetness lingers.
  Some citrus on the tongue. Texture is medium to light, average to soft carbonation
  and the citrus and spice give it a tang in the finish. I am still ambivalent about
  the ''white porter'' and wish we could have more names rather than fold beers into
  the existing categories. Overall, it tasted okay but I would not seek it out."'
