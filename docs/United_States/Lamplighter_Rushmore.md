| **Comments** | So aroma has some roasted malts and nutty notes. Pours a rich clear dark gold with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet caramel and light coffee notes. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a toffee finish. This is my third Lamplighter ale and all have been maltier than New England beer tends to favour. A pleasant surprise. |
