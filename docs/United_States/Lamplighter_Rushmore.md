Beer: Lamplighter Rushmore
BeerID: 725670
Brewer: Lamplighter Brewing Company
City: Cambridge
Comments: So aroma has some roasted malts and nutty notes. Pours a rich clear dark
  gold with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet caramel and light coffee notes. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a toffee finish. This is my third
  Lamplighter ale and all have been maltier than New England beer tends to favour.
  A pleasant surprise.
