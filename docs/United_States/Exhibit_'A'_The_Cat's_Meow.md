| **Comments** | Aroma has the regulation tropical medley mango and peach amid the citrus. Pours the equally classic murk of NEIPAs. Taste is fully fruited more mango and a slice of pineapple but the sour transition ends in an all too familiar chalky bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a chalk bitter finish. Pity. |
