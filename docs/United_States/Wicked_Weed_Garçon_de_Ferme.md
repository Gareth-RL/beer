Comments: 'Tap at The Junkyard and it seemed a logical successor to Saison Dupont
  but this is a barnyard sour. Pours cloudy yellow with lace top. Aroma is barnyard
  funk and the peaches are under ripe. Taste is sour, lactic, fruit sour. Palate is
  medium bodied sticky feel and relentlessly sour. Licking the cheese knife sour.
  Maybe it was the bad French and peaches and mention of farmhouse that misled me.
  But it will not be repeated no matter that it does go Wild '
