| **Comments** | Tap @Brewdog Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange amber. Aroma has caramel malt and plum fruit. Taste is medium sour with light sweetness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, sour finish. No idea what a Quatuor is. Nor where the sour beers at 9.5% become something more specific. But this is an interesting, refreshing if potent brew. |
