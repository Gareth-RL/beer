| **Comments** | A double New England IPA by the looks of things. Aroma is grapefruit and orange with dank malts. As a result the taste is so fruity that the  abv will sneak by your conscience. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long sweet finish like juice. A perilous thing for young chaps and chappesses at parties. |
