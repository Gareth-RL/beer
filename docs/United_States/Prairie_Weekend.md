| **Comments** | Poured cola dark brown body with tan lace halo. Aroma is richly malted with coffee chocolate and coconut notes, the latter may be what passes for marshmallow. The taste is sweet, although given what is in here, the diabetes quotient is medium and similarly the alcohol does not burn. Full body, smooth feel, soft to average carbonation, and a light bitter tea finish amidst the rich sweet goodness of this confection. One expects American craft drinkers to embrace an Imperial with a 4.0 or more but this is proving popular in Scandinavia, Scotland and Croatia, so why not in the east Midlands. A definite treat in a small unassuming bottle.  |
