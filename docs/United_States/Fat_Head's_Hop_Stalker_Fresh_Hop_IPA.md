Brewer: '"Fat Head&#39;s Brewery"'
City: Middleburg Heights
Comments: Aroma has roasted malts and light citrus hops floral notes. Pours copper
  with white lace diminishing but lasting. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some
  caramel notes. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a fuzzy
  bitter finish that lingers. Overall better than anticipated as Ohio has been oddly
  quiet in my beer scores considering its heritage and location. Maybe it is a case
  of the missing fathead.
