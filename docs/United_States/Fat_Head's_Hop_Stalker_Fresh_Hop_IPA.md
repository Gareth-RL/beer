| **Comments** | Aroma has roasted malts and light citrus hops floral notes. Pours copper with white lace diminishing but lasting. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some caramel notes. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a fuzzy bitter finish that lingers. Overall better than anticipated as Ohio has been oddly quiet in my beer scores considering its heritage and location. Maybe it is a case of the missing fathead. |
