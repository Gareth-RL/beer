| **Comments** | Light spice in the scent. Pours murky pale golden with halo of diminishing lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. A pleasant fruitiness with gentle souring (these farmers are the soft handed sort). Palate is light to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a drying finish. Overall it might keep Grisette happy. |
