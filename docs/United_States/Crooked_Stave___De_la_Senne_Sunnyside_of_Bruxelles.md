| **Comments** | Acidic nose edging vinegar. Pours cranberry juice with scummy lace top. Given the above, the taste is a pleasant surprise. Medium sweet to bitter with fruit lactose and strong berry notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily to sticky feel, average carbonation and a long fruit finish. I bought it as a refresher and it did more than its job. |
