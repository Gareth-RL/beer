Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Crooked Stave / De la Senne Sunnyside of Bruxelles
BeerID: 698514
Brewer: Crooked Stave
City: Denver
Comments: Acidic nose edging vinegar. Pours cranberry juice with scummy lace top.
  Given the above, the taste is a pleasant surprise. Medium sweet to bitter with fruit
  lactose and strong berry notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily to sticky feel, average
  carbonation and a long fruit finish. I bought it as a refresher and it did more
  than its job.
