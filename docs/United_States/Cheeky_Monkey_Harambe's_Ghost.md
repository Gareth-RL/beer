| **Comments** | Poured amber golden body with thin lace top. Aroma of honey malt and spicy hop. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with toffee note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a bitter spice finish. Relatively simple for an imperial but the burn is controlled. |
