Comments: '"Tap  @ Junkyard. Pours pale gold with white sheet lace. Aroma has hay,
  grass, herbs, to keep things ticking. Taste is medium sweet to light bitter. Palate
  medium to light body, slightly oily feel, average carbonation and a crisp finish.
  It reminded me that even a good Pilsner is still a Pilsner. Soapy."'
