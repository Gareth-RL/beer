Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black body thin tan lace halo. Aroma has
  pine licorice and tropical fruit mix. Taste is medium bitter with licorice notes.
  Palate is medium to full bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, long
  finish. A good to very good Black IPA that keeps its balance.
