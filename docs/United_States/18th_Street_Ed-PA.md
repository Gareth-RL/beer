| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours rich brown amber with some cloudiness and off white lacing. Aroma is richly toffee malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel offset by carbonation which is average +, the finish is languorous bitter. Good enough but not especially &quot;English.&quot; |
