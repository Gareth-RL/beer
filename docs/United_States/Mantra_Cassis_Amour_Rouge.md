| **Comments** | Tap at the Brewdog Nottingham. Has an intense fruity scent with dark cherry and blackcurrant evident. Pours a deep purple colour with the briefest of lace halo tops. Taste is medium to full sour with sweet grape notes. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and an astringent finish. An interesting sour but not a patch on their stouts. |
