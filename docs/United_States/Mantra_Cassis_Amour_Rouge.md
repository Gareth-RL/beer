Beer: Mantra Cassis Amour Rouge
BeerID: 463741
Brewer: Mantra Artisan Ales
City: Franklin
Comments: Tap at the Brewdog Nottingham. Has an intense fruity scent with dark cherry
  and blackcurrant evident. Pours a deep purple colour with the briefest of lace halo
  tops. Taste is medium to full sour with sweet grape notes. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture, average carbonation, and an astringent finish. An interesting sour
  but not a patch on their stouts.
