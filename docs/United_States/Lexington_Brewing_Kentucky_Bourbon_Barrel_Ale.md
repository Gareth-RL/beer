| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma is firmly Bourbon but below that lurks caramel malts and vanilla. Given that mine was emphatically brown I am bemused by the term golden in other reviews as my wedding band will never be this red. A circle of white bubbles topped the ale. Taste is toffee with an alcoholic kick. If salted caramel or Wertherâ€™s Original ever lay in a barrel in Kentucky then their popularity might sour. And children might stumble. Carbonation soft Body full. Palate loaded. No horse in this race. |
