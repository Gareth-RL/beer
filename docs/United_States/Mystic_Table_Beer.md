| **Comments** | Tap. Grassy herbal scent with yeasty notes. Pours pale yellow gold with thin white top, trifling lace. There are lemon, salty, spicy flavours. Medium sweet medium bitterness, lightly sour, in the finish. Body is light to medium. Texture is slick like heather. Reasonably lively carbonation with a gentle languorous finish. Set a place for the table. |
