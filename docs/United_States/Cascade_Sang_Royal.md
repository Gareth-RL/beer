| **Comments** | Keg at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours reddish brown amber with no lacing to speak of. Aroma is definitely red wine tannin but with cherry or plum notes. Taste is sweet to sour with the sourness above the medium range but then softening. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a sour finish with grape notes. I did not know what to expect but it certainly takes my Sour register in a new direction. |
