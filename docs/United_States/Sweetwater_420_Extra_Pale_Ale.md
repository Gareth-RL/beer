Comments: 'Bottle. Pours golden with white foam top. Aroma citric hops. Taste medium
  sweet grassy notes. Strong carbonation. Sustained finish. What an Aussie might call
  amber nectar. Tastes better with barbecue. 12/05/23 second sipping at ATL airport.
  The comments stand and the price was ludicrous '
