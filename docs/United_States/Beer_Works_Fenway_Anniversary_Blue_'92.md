| **Comments** | At Boston Beer Works. Fenway Park. Pours Amber body with white lace top and of course floating blueberries (you may find a wasteful accumulation in the bottom. ) Aroma is pretty standard pale malt and hoping berry with the barest whiff of blueberries.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter.  Palate is medium bodied oily texture, average carbonation and a  bitter finish. Overall a decent beer with an unnecessary gimmick. |
