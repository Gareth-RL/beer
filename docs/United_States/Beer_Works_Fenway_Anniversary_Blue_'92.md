Brewer: Beer Works
City: Boston
Comments: At Boston Beer Works. Fenway Park. Pours Amber body with white lace top
  and of course floating blueberries (you may find a wasteful accumulation in the
  bottom. ) Aroma is pretty standard pale malt and hoping berry with the barest whiff
  of blueberries.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter.  Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture, average carbonation and a  bitter finish. Overall a decent beer with an
  unnecessary gimmick.
