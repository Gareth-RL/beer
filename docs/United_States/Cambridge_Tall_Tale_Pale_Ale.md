| **Comments** | Aroma has floral üçë peach and that should be enough to gladden the heart. It pours clear golden with the regulation thin lacing. Taste is medium sweet and remains in that fruity zone for quite some time. But, like love, says the old man, bitterness will eventually arrive.  Thankfully - in moderation. And it goes well with the house pizza, should you be tempted.  Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish that is worth the wait. Overall, it offers more sensory stimulation than the lager, and if you no longer care about such things, seek help from a more appropriate source. I am assured, indeed badgered to add that the recipe has changed and that as the House pale, this beer is taller than ever  |
