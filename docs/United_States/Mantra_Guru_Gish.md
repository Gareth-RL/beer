| **Comments** | Tap @ Brewdog Nottingham. Pours black with thin lace halo. Aroma is redolent with salted peanuts with background notes of caramel malts and vanilla. Taste is medium sweetness, then medium bitterness, with a lightly salty finish. Palate is medium body, creamy, soft carbonation, bitter, finish. Very pleasant stout. |
