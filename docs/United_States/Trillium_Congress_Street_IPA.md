| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden body with broken loose lacing. Aroma has the citric piney medley with pineapple melon and peach notes. Taste is dank fruity medium sweet to bitter but with complex layering. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel, average carbonation and a bitter flinty finish. Part of their core range and you can see why. |
