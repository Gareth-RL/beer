Beer: Trillium Congress Street IPA
BeerID: 232181
Brewer: Trillium Brewing Company
City: Boston
Comments: Poured hazy golden body with broken loose lacing. Aroma has the citric piney
  medley with pineapple melon and peach notes. Taste is dank fruity medium sweet to
  bitter but with complex layering. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel, average carbonation
  and a bitter flinty finish. Part of their core range and you can see why.
