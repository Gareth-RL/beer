| **Comments** | Poured rich chestnut body with tan lace top. Aroma was roasted malts with chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is medium sweet but the dominant taste is bitter which is quick to arrive and slow to leave. There's almost an ashy quality to it. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and that sharpening bitterness. It made me appreciate the merits of English-style porter. |
