Comments: 'Pours slightly hazy golden with white lace. Aroma has tangerine and pineapple
  and a backnote of grapefruit. Taste is richly fruity with the sweetness fully blended
  with bitter pith and some sourness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average
  carbonation and a long finish. Not as impressed as some reviewers, but this is certainly
  a pale that delivers flavour  '
