| **Comments** | Keg at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours pale amber gold with full white lace. Aroma has grassy pine hops and pale malts. Taste is lightly sweet and medium bitter intensifying to a strong grainy bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture soft to average carbonation, bitter finish. A refreshing summer pale. |
