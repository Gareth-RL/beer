| **Comments** | Pours hazy cloudy yellow body (not like European pilsner). Aroma is lightly lemony grassy hop. Taste is lightly sweet to grainy bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall not a convincing case for NZ hops as the basis for Pilsner. |
