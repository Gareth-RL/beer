Brewer: Westbrook Brewing
City: Mount Pleasant
Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Aroma is richly chocolate caramel and
  for me hints of peanut. Pours black with tan brown lace and scum on top. Taste is
  sweet, gobsmacking best gelato of the day sweet with chocolate and coffee and toffee
  taking a bow. This is the kind of beer that could corrupt your Grandma &#40;assuming
  and this may eliminate over 90% of RB grandmothers, that she was not already entrenched
  in that particular category&#41;. But I think a wide distribution to seniors in
  South Carolina would have stalled the Confederacy. Palate is so smooth that medium
  bodied seems to clumsy a term, carbonation adds sparkle to a stout that might drown
  you in your own delight. One is left wishing the brewery many more years. "'
