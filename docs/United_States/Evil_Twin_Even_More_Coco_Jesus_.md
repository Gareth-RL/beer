| **Comments** | Aroma has dark malts with coffee cocoa coconut and alcohol all present and correct. Pours black with fading tan lace halo. Taste is medium to full sweet with the maple syrup more evident on the tongue and other sugars fighting the alcohol effect keeping the heat in check. Palate is full to medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter alcohol finish. Maybe if the can hadn't been in the chill cabinet so long then the flavours would be more abundant. Still luxuriant but more alcohol evident than the room temperature version. It teeters on the edge of excellence but somehow like a student who is not quite a First it stays on the lower side. Certainly one to return to. |
