| **Comments** | Pours reddish Amber with lace halo.  Aroma is grainy roasted malts with light toffee notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a sour finish.  It was the closest thing to porter available.  The granola did not overwhelm.  |
