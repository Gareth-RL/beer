| **Comments** | Aroma moderate, rustic malt, herbal hop note. Poured  murky pale orange body and initially a towering foam head which died back eventually to broken lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter/sour. Some citrus in the taste and a sour tang. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to fizzy carbonation and the bitter finish. Not as overwhelmingly fruity as some NEIPA because of the hop mix but still a tasty pale. |
