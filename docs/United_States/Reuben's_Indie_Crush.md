| **Comments** | A juicy peach citrus crush with strawberry notes.  Pours hazy orange juice body off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to fuzzy sour like juice after toothpaste. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a clinging finish. It grew less pleasing as I went along - is can happen. |
