| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and tan halo lace. Aroma is richly malted dark fruits burnt toffee and a hint of peat. Taste is medium to full sweet with a bitter background. Palate is medium bodied +, sticky texture, light carbonation, and a caramel swirl of a finish. Very nice indeed. Wonder why they dropped the&quot;bastard&quot; in the name? |
