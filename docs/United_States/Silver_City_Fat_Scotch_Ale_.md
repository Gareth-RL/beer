Brewer: Silver City Brewery

Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and tan halo lace.
  Aroma is richly malted dark fruits burnt toffee and a hint of peat. Taste is medium
  to full sweet with a bitter background. Palate is medium bodied +, sticky texture,
  light carbonation, and a caramel swirl of a finish. Very nice indeed. Wonder why
  they dropped the&quot;bastard&quot; in the name?
