| **Comments** | @City Tap Boston. Pours rich brown Amber with lace halo.  Aroma has cereal malt and cherry with even a balsamic note. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with languid brandied sweetness before the mellow bitter finish.  Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Good but not well integrated. Flavours seemed to diverge rather than compliment each other.  |
