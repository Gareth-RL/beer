Comments: Pours cloudy hazy golden body with foam white top. Aroma has mango and other
  tropical fruits. Taste is medium sweet with a decent transition to a mellow bitterness.
  Palate is medium bodied, average carbonation, smooth texture and a chewy resinous
  finish. Enjoyable, even if it would taste better on a warmer day.
