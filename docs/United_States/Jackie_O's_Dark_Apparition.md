Comments: Aroma of rich roasted malts raisins and dark fruits, sweet licorice and
  mellow coffee.  Pours black bodied with tan lacing mostly diminishing. Palate is
  medium to full bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a n alcoholic finish. Definitely
  my kind of thing but just a little rough around the edges.
