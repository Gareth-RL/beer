| **Comments** | Tap at the Todd English PUB in Birmingham AL. Aroma has berry fruits, It pours rose colored with off white lace top. Taste is medium sweetness, lightly sour. Palate has medium body, sticky, soft to average carbonation, and a sour finish. Refreshing but it would taste better on a warm summer day. |
