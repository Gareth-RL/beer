Brewer: Cambridge Brewing Company (Castle Island Brewing)

Comments: 'Aroma is dark and malty but not as toffee tending as I like. Pours rich
  deep chestnut with ruby lights and thin lacing. Taste is medium to full sweet, with
  a little background berry and stone fruits.  Palate is medium to full bodied, sticky
  feel, soft to average carbonation and a long smooth finish. The Scotch ale is like
  the Scotch brilliant but unpredictable. Predictably, this Englishman failed to find
  the brilliance '
