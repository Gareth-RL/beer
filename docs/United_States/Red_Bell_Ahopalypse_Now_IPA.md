Beer: Red Bell Ahopalypse Now IPA
BeerID: 12849
Brewer: Red Bell Brewery & Pub
City: Philadelphia
Comments: Cask. Light hoppy floral, yeasty. Pours light copper to amber with white
  lacing. A well balanced flavour that has a solid biscuit counterpoint to the hops
  that linger in the end. One man’s balance is another man’s blandness so in this
  apocalypse we end with whimper.
