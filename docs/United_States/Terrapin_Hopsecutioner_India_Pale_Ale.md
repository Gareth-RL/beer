Beer: Terrapin Hopsecutioner India Pale Ale
BeerID: 106391
Brewer: Terrapin Beer Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors)
City: Athens
Comments: Tap. Aroma pale malts and hop fruits. Pours bright amber, slightly hazy
  with broken white lacing from a thin top. Taste is predominantly hoppy. My guess
  would be the Centennial outshines the others. Medium carbonation. The sweet start
  folds into a lasting bitter finish. A beer to have before that last cigar, the blindfold,
  and the order Fire.
