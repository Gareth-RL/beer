Brewer: Westbrook Brewing
City: Mount Pleasant
Comments: Can. Aroma is more funky than spicy. Appearance is a cloudy orange with
  the thinnest ring of white lace. Taste certainly yields ginger notes. Medium sour.
  Light bitterness. Medium body with flat carbonation and an oily finish. Maybe I
  missed something but uninspiring.
