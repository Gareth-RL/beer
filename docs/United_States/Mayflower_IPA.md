Comments: 'Tap. Aroma pine and citrus notes but not as pungent as some beers with
  west coast hops. Pours amber gold with thin white top and broken lace. Initial taste
  is lightly sweet with some background saltiness. There is a pleasant malt backbone
  here that textures the shift to a medium bitter finish. medium body, soft carbonation,
  thin feel, mean that it is a good IPA that I won’t remember '
