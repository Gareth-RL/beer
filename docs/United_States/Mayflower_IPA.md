| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma pine and citrus notes but not as pungent as some beers with west coast hops. Pours amber gold with thin white top and broken lace. Initial taste is lightly sweet with some background saltiness. There is a pleasant malt backbone here that textures the shift to a medium bitter finish. medium body, soft carbonation, thin feel, mean that it is a good IPA that I won’t remember  |
