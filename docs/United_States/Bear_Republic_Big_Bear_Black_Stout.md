City: Cloverdale
Comments: Tap at the Lord Hobo. Mainly because I couldn’t see the menu in the murk.But
  the mocha scent reassured me. As did the dark chocolate body. Taste is toffees and
  coffee with medium sweetness that lingers through to a salty finish. Now I wait
  to see how much my lucky dip cost.
