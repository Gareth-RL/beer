| **Comments** | Pours cloudy pale gold with white lace diminishing.  The aroma has spicy coriander notes. Taste has the banana notes of a classic wheat beer. Sweet predominantly with a light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a soft bitter finish. I liked it but I wish American bars served smaller offerings. |
