| **Comments** | Aroma has pineapple and citrus predominant. Pours golden with a very thin top. Taste is medium bitter to medium sweet with biscuit malts and hop fruits evident. Palate is medium bodied soft carbonation and there&#39;s a long bitter finish. Overall good but not great, but it was shared at a festival with friends on an evening of largely dark beer so maybe it suffered by comparison. |
