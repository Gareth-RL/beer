Comments: '"Aroma has pineapple and citrus predominant. Pours golden with a very thin
  top. Taste is medium bitter to medium sweet with biscuit malts and hop fruits evident.
  Palate is medium bodied soft carbonation and there&#39;s a long bitter finish. Overall
  good but not great, but it was shared at a festival with friends on an evening of
  largely dark beer so maybe it suffered by comparison."'
