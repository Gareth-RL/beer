Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden amber with thin lace top. Aroma is hoppy
  with definite lemon edge. Taste is medium sour to bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  slick feel, average carbonation, astringent finish. I ordered it to cleanse the
  palate and boost my Irish sampling. It did both.
