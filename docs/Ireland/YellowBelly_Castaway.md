Comments: '"Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours hazy golden body thin lace top. Aroma
  has tropical fruit including the boasted passionfruit, but there&#39;s lemon and
  tangerines as well. Taste is medium to full sweet to medium sour. Palate is medium
  bodied, slick texture, average carbonation, and a long fruit finish. A refreshing
  sour."'
