| **Comments** | Aroma has roasted malts and a light vanilla note. Pours Black body with broken lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter in the finish. Palate is thin to medium bodied, grainy texture which reflected average to fizzy carbonation. Drying finish. Certainly not a Guinness clone.  |
