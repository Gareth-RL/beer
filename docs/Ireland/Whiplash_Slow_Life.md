| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of roasted malts coffee grounds chocolate hint of cream. Medium bodied watery texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. The taste and texture didn't gel for me as stout. 27/03/24 clearly a Junkyard favourite and the taste seems better this time.                                                                                      |
