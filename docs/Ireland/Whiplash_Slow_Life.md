Comments: '"Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of roasted malts coffee grounds
  chocolate hint of cream. Medium bodied watery texture average to soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. The taste and texture didn''t gel for me as stout. 27/03/24
  clearly a Junkyard favourite and the taste seems better this time."'
