| **Comments** | Aroma delivers - pastry and caramel sweetness. Pours dark mahogany body with thin tan lace. Taste is full sweetness but it's labelled pastry stout so what do you expect? So Uber sweet to just sweet. Maybe a hint of bitter chocolate at the end. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long finish. White Hag are the one craft brewery I know that seem to have grasped the challenge for the land of Guinness. |
