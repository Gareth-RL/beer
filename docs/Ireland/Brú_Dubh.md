| **Comments** | Cask. Pours ruby black with thick cream head. Aroma lasted malts and toasted bread. Tastes similarly with sweet caramel to the fore on a biscuity base with some saltiness at the end. No more than medium bodied as today’s stout are wont to be. It’s chief charm today was that it was free on St Patrick’s Day to anyone wearing the green. Thanks to my scarf  |
