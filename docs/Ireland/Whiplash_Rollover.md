| **Comments** | Aroma has lemon rind and pineapple with papaya lurking. Pours hazy almost milky golden with lasting white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied creamy smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. Gives a lot of flavour for the payload. |
