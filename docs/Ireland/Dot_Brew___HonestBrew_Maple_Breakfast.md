| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body with diminishing tan head. Aroma has chocolate and coffee but surprisingly little maple syrup. Taste is light to medium sweet to light bitter with maybe a hint of syrup at the back end of the swallow. Palate is light to medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Ideal for those among you who are abstemious with your maple syrup on your breakfast pancakes. Can from HonestBrew for St Patrick's Day |
