| **Comments** | Can from Honest Brew. Poured pale golden body with deep white foam. Aroma of piney grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet to medium drying bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, drying in the mouth but over-carbonated in the can. Mine was initially two-thirds foam despite a slow pour. From the beer I tasted this is a nicely hopped IPA that delivers well for the low abv. |
