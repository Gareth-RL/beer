| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours dark body and tan cream top. Aroma is licorice coffee and coconut malts. Taste is medium bitter but only after a lengthy pause and below the bitterness there are delicious sweet notes that compliment nicely the whole effect. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture especially for a porter, carbonation average to soft, and a long rich finish. This one grew on me and I would happily have it again. |
