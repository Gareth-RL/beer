Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Kinnegar Yannaroddy Porter
BeerID: 240804
Brewer: Kinnegar Brewing
City: Letterkenny
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog. Pours dark body and tan cream top. Aroma is licorice coffee
  and coconut malts. Taste is medium bitter but only after a lengthy pause and below
  the bitterness there are delicious sweet notes that compliment nicely the whole
  effect. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture especially for a porter, carbonation
  average to soft, and a long rich finish. This one grew on me and I would happily
  have it again.
