Overall: 12.0
MyScore: 3.2
Comments: Poured amber body off white lace top. Aroma of biscuit malts and berry hops. Medium sweet to lightly bitter. Hoppy finish. Medium bodied grainy floury feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. A good example of the average for Irish brewing. And that's the strange thing
