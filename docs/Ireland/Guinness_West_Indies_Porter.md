City: Dublin
Comments: Bottle. Chilled. Aroma very toffee with coffee notes. Dark body ruby tints
  with thin broken tan top. For me the taste was spoiled by over carbonation I don’t
  need my porter to fizz. It certainly cloys what should be a smooth caramel. And
  mars the hop fruits. Maybe this would taste better after two weeks at sea but if
  it has this much gas in it, there may be trouble below decks.
