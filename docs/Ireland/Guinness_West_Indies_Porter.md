| **Comments** | Bottle. Chilled. Aroma very toffee with coffee notes. Dark body ruby tints with thin broken tan top. For me the taste was spoiled by over carbonation I donâ€™t need my porter to fizz. It certainly cloys what should be a smooth caramel. And mars the hop fruits. Maybe this would taste better after two weeks at sea but if it has this much gas in it, there may be trouble below decks. |
