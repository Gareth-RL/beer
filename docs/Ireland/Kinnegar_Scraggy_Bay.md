| **Comments** | Can from Honest Brew. Poured golden clear body with white foam lace diminishing to thin top. Aroma is hop dominated: grapefruit, other citrus and maybe a hint of peach at the back. Taste is lightly sweet to medium to sharp bitterness with some acidity. Snappy, the brewer terms it. Palate is light to medium, some tackiness on the tongue, average to full carbonation in the canned version, and the definite bitter finish. Overall, it seems to do itself justice as an IPA with enough New World hop to indicate it nods westwards  |
