| **Comments** | Can from HonestBrew. Poured orange amber with a full white foam top. Aroma is malt dominant with hints of caramel malt and grapefruit hop. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the malt backbone evident, although the grapefruit citrus notes are also in there but more as a confusion than a complement; not sure they combine well. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, slightly gummy aftertaste after average carbonation and a bitter fruit finish. decent enough but not an intersection I would seek out. |
