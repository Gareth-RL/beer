| **Comments** | Floral soft tropical fruit aroma peach and red grapefruit. Poured hazy golden body loose white foam top. Taste is medium sweet with more of a citric take--so more grapefruit and some light lemon. Palate is medium to light bodied, juicy feel, average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish with lingering fruitiness. Certainly a full hop range evident with a modest pale malt providing easy drinking. Part of HonestBrew's St Patrick's Day sampling. |
