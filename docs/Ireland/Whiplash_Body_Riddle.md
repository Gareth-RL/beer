Comments: '"Floral soft tropical fruit aroma peach and red grapefruit. Poured hazy
  golden body loose white foam top. Taste is medium sweet with more of a citric take--so
  more grapefruit and some light lemon. Palate is medium to light bodied, juicy feel,
  average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish with lingering fruitiness.
  Certainly a full hop range evident with a modest pale malt providing easy drinking.
