| **Comments** | Scent combines grapefruit and roasted malts. Pours copper with off white lace (struck by the range of description among reviewers - odd, frankly). Taste is medium bitter but with a rich fruitiness suggestive of pomegranate! Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Tis a rare thing, a good Irish craft beer, may it multiply. |
