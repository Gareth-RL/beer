Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: O Brother / White Hag Moonlight Maze
BeerID: 789070
Brewer: O Brother Brewing
City: Kilcoole
Comments: Aroma has some tropical funk and little light pineapple but all on the modest
  side. It pours hazy yellow body with a halo of lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  sour with a drying finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation
  and a dry bitter finish. Overall slightly disappointing and I cannot envisage a
  session of this.
