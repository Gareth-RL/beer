| **Comments** | Aroma has some tropical funk and little light pineapple but all on the modest side. It pours hazy yellow body with a halo of lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a drying finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Overall slightly disappointing and I cannot envisage a session of this. |
