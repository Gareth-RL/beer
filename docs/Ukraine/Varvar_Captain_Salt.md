Comments: Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma of coriander melon and brine. Medium sweet to sour lightly citrus but with a salty bite in the finish. Light to medium bodied the salt dents the smoothness soft to average carbonation and a salty finish. The clue is in the name. Gose with the salt.
