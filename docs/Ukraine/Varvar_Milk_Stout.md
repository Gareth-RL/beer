Comments: '"Poured a black body tan foam top lasting lace. Aroma coffee milk chocolate
  roasted malts. Medium sweet to lightly bitter since the lactose seeps through the
  transition as does the coffee taste which also lingers in the bitter finish. Medium
  bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish with a languor
  that pleases. I am liking it more as it goes. Is that because it''s my third and
  it''s 6%. Maybe "'
