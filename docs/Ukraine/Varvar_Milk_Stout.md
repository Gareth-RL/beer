| **Comments**  | Poured a black body tan foam top lasting lace. Aroma coffee milk chocolate roasted malts. Medium sweet to lightly bitter since the lactose seeps through the transition as does the coffee taste which also lingers in the bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish with a languor that pleases. I am liking it more as it goes. Is that because it's my third and it's 6%. Maybe                                                                                       |
