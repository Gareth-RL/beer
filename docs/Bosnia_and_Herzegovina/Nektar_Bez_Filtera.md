Comments: My second Herzegovina beer. Citrus hop scent. Hazy orange body. White foam top. Medium sweet to bitter: Some orange, some lemon. some soap! Medium bodied, soapy texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. I can't say that I am becoming a fan of the beers of this region, but it is drinkable. From the supermarket Iperlando 1 euro 90 so not a lot of money to waste.
