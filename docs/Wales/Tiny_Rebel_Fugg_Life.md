| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John. Pours golden with white lace top. Aroma is floral and earthy with the vital hint of biscuit. Taste is medium bitter. But the fruit and wood are there. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and the great British twiggy finish. Fuggles emphatically. And twigs are dry. |
