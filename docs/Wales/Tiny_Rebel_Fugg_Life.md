Beer: Tiny Rebel Fugg Life
BeerID: 436703
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Cask at the Sir John. Pours golden with white lace top. Aroma is floral
  and earthy with the vital hint of biscuit. Taste is medium bitter. But the fruit
  and wood are there. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation,
  and the great British twiggy finish. Fuggles emphatically. And twigs are dry.
