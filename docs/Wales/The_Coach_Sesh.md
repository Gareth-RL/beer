| **Comments** | Pours hazy honey gold thin lace halo. Aroma is fruity in a generally citrus direction. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture average carbonation and a musty finish on the tongue. Drunk largely to boost my meagre Welsh total. Otherwise ordinary. |
