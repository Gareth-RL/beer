Comments: Pours hazy honey gold thin lace halo. Aroma is fruity in a generally citrus
  direction. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, smooth
  texture average carbonation and a musty finish on the tongue. Drunk largely to boost
  my meagre Welsh total. Otherwise ordinary.
