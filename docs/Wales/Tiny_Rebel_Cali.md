| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden, off white lace halo. Aroma is bread malts and citric hops. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sour. Palate medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, sour finish. All the familiar ingredients are there save inspiration which is more evident in the blurb than the beer. 8/06/18 tiny rebel tap takeover at The Overdraught pours golden with a lot more foam. Aroma is hoppier than I remember. And the sourness is also more evident. But the rating stays the same. |
