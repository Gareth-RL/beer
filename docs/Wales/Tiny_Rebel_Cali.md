Beer: Tiny Rebel Cali
BeerID: 391940
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden, off white lace halo. Aroma is bread malts
  and citric hops. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sour. Palate medium bodied,
  oily texture, soft carbonation, sour finish. All the familiar ingredients are there
  save inspiration which is more evident in the blurb than the beer. 8/06/18 tiny
  rebel tap takeover at The Overdraught pours golden with a lot more foam. Aroma is
  hoppier than I remember. And the sourness is also more evident. But the rating stays
  the same.
