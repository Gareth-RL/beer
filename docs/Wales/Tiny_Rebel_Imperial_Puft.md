| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma is formidable &#40;in the French sense&#41;. Return of the marshmallows indeed with bubble gum and candied fruits and coffee percolating. A dark bodied ale with off white almost tan lace swirl. Taste is heavy cloying sweetness, lightly sour, lightly bitter, salty, and overall it settles below the cloying threshold but we are still in funfair territory. Palate is full bodied, texture creamy, carbonation average &#40;enough to impede the cloy&#41;. Finish is long, and languorous and sweet. Remember when you had too much candyfloss..... A la recherche du temps perdu. |
