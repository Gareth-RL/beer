| **Comments** | Tap at Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours murky orange pale with thin lace top. Aroma has pineapple grapefruit and spice note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel due to lactose factor soft to average carbonation and a long finish. I can get the milkshake reference but the Christmas label is just gratuitous marketing spiel. Easy drinking. |
