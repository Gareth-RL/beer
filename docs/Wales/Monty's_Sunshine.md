| **Comments** | Pours orange golden body and sizeable, lasting foam top. Aroma has a marmalade, honeyed apricot scent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite tang in the finish. Palate is medium to thin bodied, slightly grainy in texture, average carbonation and a lasting bitter finish. My first Monty and a decent session ale. |
