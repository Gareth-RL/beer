| **Comments** | Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma is tinned tropical like opening a jar of sweets &#40;not bad in itself but less expected with a beer&#41;. The taste consequently is sweet with not a lot of other things gaining an audience. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a sweet end. And isn&#39;t this what we all hope for? Possibly not in a beer. Overall it&#39;s a sweetshop of a beer. Rumour has it that this may attract women. But then again rumour is a cad. |
