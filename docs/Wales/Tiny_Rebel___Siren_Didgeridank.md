| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham as they have a Tiny Rebel collaboration tap takeover. Pours profoundly murky orange with scummy top. Aroma has the tropical fruity qualities of a hop forward pale with decided pine notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter &#40;therein lies controversy&#41;. Palate is medium bodied, texture is oily verging on sticky, carbonation soft, and a languid as opposed to languorous finish &#40;how lazy can a beer be&#41;. Dank may be the word. Overall this is good beer but in a style where bad is usually a result of error. I had high expectations and feel disappointed. They should collaborate on an APA. |
