| **Comments** | Tap. Pours cola black with a thin tan top. Aroma is sweet and the marshmallows make an emphatically scented appearance. The taste is similarly wrapped in candy but not distressingly so if you take your novelty beers in small measures. Taste is heavy cloying sweetness, lightly bitter, so don&#39;t get a pint |
