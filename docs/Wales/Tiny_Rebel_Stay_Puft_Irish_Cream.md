Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: The scent gives the game away having a vanilla dairy note but I did not
  get too much from the chocolate malts. Taste is similarly creamy with a lasting
  sweetness. Palate was a little lacking in depth and overall it was a reasonable
  dessert without ever seeming great
