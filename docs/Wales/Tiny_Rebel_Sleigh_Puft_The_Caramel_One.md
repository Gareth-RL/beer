Comments: '"Poured murky cloudy brown with thin tan lacing. Aroma emphatically caramel
  and marshmallow and chocolate. Full to mellow sweet with not a lot of room left
  for bitterness. Medium bodied clammy texture soft carbonation and a light sweet
  finish. It''s certainly pastry but is it beer? Off-putting look as well "'
