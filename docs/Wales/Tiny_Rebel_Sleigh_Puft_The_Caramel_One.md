| **Comments**  | Poured murky cloudy brown with thin tan lacing. Aroma emphatically caramel and marshmallow and chocolate. Full to mellow sweet with not a lot of room left for bitterness. Medium bodied clammy texture soft carbonation and a light sweet finish. It's certainly pastry but is it beer? Off-putting look as well                                                                                       |
