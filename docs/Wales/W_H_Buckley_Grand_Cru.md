| **Comments** | Very much on offer at JDW. Pours dark amber brown body off white lacing. Aroma has roasted malts and berry malt with the malt flavours dominant. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a malty biscuit finish. Better than expected. |
