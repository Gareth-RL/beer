Comments: Very much on offer at JDW. Pours dark amber brown body off white lacing.
  Aroma has roasted malts and berry malt with the malt flavours dominant. Taste is
  medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a malty biscuit finish. Better than expected.
