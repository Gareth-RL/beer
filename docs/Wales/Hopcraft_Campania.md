| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black body tan cream head. Aroma has the required chocolate vanilla strawberry in that order. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but it is what Neapolitan cream stout should taste like. Palate is medium bodied, just below creamy texture for me, soft carbonation, and a watery finish but a worthy effort indeed. |
