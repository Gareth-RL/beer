Beer: Hopcraft Campania
BeerID: 507702
Brewer: Hopcraft Brewing
City: Pontyclun
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black body tan cream head. Aroma
  has the required chocolate vanilla strawberry in that order. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly bitter but it is what Neapolitan cream stout should taste like. Palate
  is medium bodied, just below creamy texture for me, soft carbonation, and a watery
  finish but a worthy effort indeed.
