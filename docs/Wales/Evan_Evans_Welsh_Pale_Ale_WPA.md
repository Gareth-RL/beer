Comments: '"Poured clear golden body (once it settled). Thin white lace diminishing
  to wash. Aroma of light hop fruit and pale malt fleetingly floral. Medium sweet
  to bitter with some honey notes in the sweet and a little spice in the bitter finish.
  Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Session
  worthy but that''s the sum total of my generosity."'
