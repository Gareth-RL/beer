Comments: '"Aroma has chocolate malt and vanilla but the coconuts eluded me. Poured
  black bodied with coffee tan cream lace top. Taste is medium sweet with coconut
  evident. Slow transition to a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it manages its sweet kicks well.
  And it''s smooth."'
