| **Comments** | Vanilla white chocolate and peach aroma. Poured a murky brown yellow orange mess with thin lace. Taste is medium to full sweetness with chocolate and vanilla prevalent. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a long sweet taste - it sours a little but otherwise it's a candy store. |
