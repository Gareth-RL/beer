Comments: '"Poured dark brown with ruby lights. Tan cream lace top. Aroma has caramel
  and coffee. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Malty but with some hop fruits coming
  through. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish.  Judging by the other reviews it''s a beer that needs good cellaring. This
  was very nice."'
