| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with ruby lights. Tan cream lace top. Aroma has caramel and coffee. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Malty but with some hop fruits coming through. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Judging by the other reviews it's a beer that needs good cellaring. This was very nice. |
