BeerID: 704359
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: You may be unsurprised to hear that the molasses reach the nose before the
  pomegranate. Aroma is malty. Pours amber solid white lace. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter, thanks to the previously elusive pomegranate. Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel soft carbonation and a sweet finish. Through it all, molasses pours.
  So a smooth if not a cool choice.
