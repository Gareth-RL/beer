| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma is tropical and citric mango grapefruit papaya. Pours amber gold with thin white top that yields broken lace. Taste is vibrantly hops and pale malts with that slightly tremulous grainy register. Body is medium. Finish is soft with some oiliness on the palate. A beer worth sharing ideally on a summer like day. So Nottingham in March. |
