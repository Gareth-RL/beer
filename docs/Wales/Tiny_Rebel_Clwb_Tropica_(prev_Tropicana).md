Beer: Tiny Rebel Clwb Tropica (prev Tropicana)
BeerID: 398179
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Tap. Aroma is tropical and citric mango grapefruit papaya. Pours amber gold
  with thin white top that yields broken lace. Taste is vibrantly hops and pale malts
  with that slightly tremulous grainy register. Body is medium. Finish is soft with
  some oiliness on the palate. A beer worth sharing ideally on a summer like day.
  So Nottingham in March.
