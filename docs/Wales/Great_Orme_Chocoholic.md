| **Comments** | Aroma has milk chocolate and berry fruits. Pours dark chestnut with little or no top which was a surprise. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and always chocolate. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not as rich as anticipated and for some that might be an asset  |
