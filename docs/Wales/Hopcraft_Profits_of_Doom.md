Beer: Hopcraft Profits of Doom
BeerID: 296264
Brewer: Hopcraft Brewing
City: Pontyclun
Comments: Cask at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cola body thin broken lace top.
  And I expect a  stout to keep its head. Aroma milk chocolate dark malts. Taste is
  medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied at the least, texture smooth
  and creamy, carbonation soft to average, and a finish that lingers pleasantly. This
  grew on me.
