| **Comments** | Poured murky golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has lemon and pine notes. Taste is medium sweet to grainy bitter which is an interesting transition as I tend to drink sweet malt beers that move to hop bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a light mineral finish. The last was a disappointment since the rest was session worthy |
