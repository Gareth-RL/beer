| **Comments** | The weird world of the modern drinker. This lager was the darkest beer i tried with a pleasant roasted malts look and taste. Aroma  of light toasted malt. Medium sweet to bitter with toffee malt and a bitter finish.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  You wouldn't think it came from S Wales! |
