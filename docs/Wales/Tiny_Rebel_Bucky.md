Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Keg at The Overdraught. Aroma has a rich roasted malt nose with some soft
  berry fruit. Pours amber bodied with thin lace top. Taste is medium bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily feel, average to fizzy on the carbonation, and a crisp bitter
  finish. No aficionado of red American amber ales, but this will do for now.
