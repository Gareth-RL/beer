| **Comments** | Keg at The Overdraught. Aroma has a rich roasted malt nose with some soft berry fruit. Pours amber bodied with thin lace top. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to fizzy on the carbonation, and a crisp bitter finish. No aficionado of red American amber ales, but this will do for now. |
