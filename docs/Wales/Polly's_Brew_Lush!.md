| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma has the fruit mix of New world hop. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with peach and pineapple blending nicely. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a crisp bitter finish. It will taste even better in the sunshine. |
