BeerID: 499776
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Cask. Aroma full of citrus fruit. Pours golden with white top. Strong initial
  lacing. Taste is grapefruit zest and grassy hops with biscuit malt. Medium light
  body and soft carbonation but some tingle in the finish. If all pale was like this
  I might abandon the dark side.
