| **Comments**  | Pinkish murky brew. Aroma is equally murky but there's citrus somewhere. Medium sweet to sour with nothing but fruit to note. Light to medium bodied slightly grainy and a bitter mineral finish. The Zombies obviously won.                                                                                      |
