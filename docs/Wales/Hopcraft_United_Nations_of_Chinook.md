Beer: Hopcraft United Nations of Chinook
BeerID: 616721
Brewer: Hopcraft Brewing
City: Pontyclun
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden amber with white lace
  top. Aroma had a toffee malt nose for me which may denote Chinook indirectly. Taste
  is light to medium bitter and a bit dull which is not great. Palate is medium bodied
  oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. But still thin. The United
  Nations need better beer.
