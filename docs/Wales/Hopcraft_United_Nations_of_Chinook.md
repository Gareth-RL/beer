| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden amber with white lace top. Aroma had a toffee malt nose for me which may denote Chinook indirectly. Taste is light to medium bitter and a bit dull which is not great. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. But still thin. The United Nations need better beer. |
