Comments: 'Cask. Aroma of cafetiere coffee with just a hint of smoked malt. Dark with
  tan cream head that paints rather than laces the glass. The smokiness is more evident
  in the taste alongside caramelized malts with some fruit notes too. This may be
  too slim bodied for some stout drinkers but it grew on me. '
