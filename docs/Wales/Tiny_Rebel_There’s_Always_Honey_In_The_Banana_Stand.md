BeerID: 592791
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught. Pours murky cloudy pale amber with white foam top.
  Aroma has all the banana one could wish for and a cereal note as tribute to the
  oats. Taste is medium sweet to sour. With ripe banana persisting. Palate is medium
  to full bodied owing to the creamy texture, carbonation is average, and the finish
  is long with  further oaten notes. The jury is out for me on Wheat Beers but this
  is okay.
