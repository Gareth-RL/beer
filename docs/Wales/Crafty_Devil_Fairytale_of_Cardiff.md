| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours dark brown with tan circle top. Aroma is After Eight mint. Taste is pretty much the same. Palate is medium bodied, creamy round the edges, carbonation average when soft would suffice, finish is long and slightly cloying. Overall it depends what a wafer thin mint denotes to you. In Cardiff it signifies Christmas. |
