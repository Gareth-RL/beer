BeerID: 704353
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Aroma has acid citrus fruits. Pours hazy golden honey with white lace halo.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft carbonation
  and a long finish.  Not sure this would be my session pale, but it is fine enough.
