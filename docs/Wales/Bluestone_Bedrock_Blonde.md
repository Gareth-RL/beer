| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body white lace top. Aroma lactic with background fruit. Taste light to medium sweet to bitter. More malt than expected and that cream quality isn't quite integrated with the citrus. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Session worthy  |
