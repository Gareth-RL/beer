| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with white lace top. Aroma has the promised hints of jam and donut stickiness but thankfully not overwhelmingly. So you have to respect the audacity &#40;or maybe not.&#41;  Thankfully the malts ensure that the taste is largely medium sweet to sour with a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, long finish that again is graciously un-donut like. So don&#39;t shun the label. |
