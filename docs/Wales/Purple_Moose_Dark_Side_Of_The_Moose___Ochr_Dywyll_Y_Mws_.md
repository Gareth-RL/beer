Comments: I have been looking to re-rate this as the first was so obviously spoiled.
  Cask. Aroma of caramel malt and fruit. Mahogany body thin tan head. It took  a while
  to settle. Taste of prunes and other dark fruits with malty undertow. Still a bit
  baffled how this won a prize but palatable.
