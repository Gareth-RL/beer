| **Comments** | I have been looking to re-rate this as the first was so obviously spoiled. Cask. Aroma of caramel malt and fruit. Mahogany body thin tan head. It took  a while to settle. Taste of prunes and other dark fruits with malty undertow. Still a bit baffled how this won a prize but palatable. |
