| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours a clear amber with white lace top. Grainy sweet scent with more butterscotch elements than I expected. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a little heat in the finish. Potent but expertly done. |
