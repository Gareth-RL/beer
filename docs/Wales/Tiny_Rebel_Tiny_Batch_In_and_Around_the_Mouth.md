| **Comments** | Keg at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours murky gold body thin lace top. Aroma has tropical hop notes and rich roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, a sweet grainy finish. Good without ever threatening excellence. |
