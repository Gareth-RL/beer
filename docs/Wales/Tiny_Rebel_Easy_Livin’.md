Comments: '"My appreciation of good session ale is growing. There''s a surfeit of
  fruity IPA but lower abv seems to make many brewers lose their way. This has a medley
  of tropical fruit scent pineapple and peach and melon notes. It pours hazy golden
  body with broken lacing. Taste is slightly tart with a lemony edge to the the forward
  sweetness and this mellowed a little to a light sweet finish. Palate is medium bodied
  clammy feel average carbonation and a sweet finish. A summer session in a garden
  setting would suit me."'
