| **Comments** | Keg at The Overdraught Nottingham. There seems to be a lot more Hopcraft about and this is an oddity. Pours dark brown with a thin head that dissipating quickly. Aroma has a very odd mix some lactose some herbs some cinnamon and struggling inside a hint of coffee or chocolate oh and lime. Taste is medium sweet but with a peculiar medical tang. Like lime and eucalyptus. Palate is medium bodied at best, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a languorous finish as one&#39;s tongue mumbles&quot;what the f**k&quot;. Dits de sang indeed. If I was Catalan I&#39;d sue. |
