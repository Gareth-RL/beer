Comments: '"Cask. Pours pale gold with white lace top. Aroma is lightly floral hops
  but not overwhelmingly so. Bit of citric pith as well. Taste is easy going light
  sweet. Palate is medium to light body, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a soft
  finish. Overall a beer you could drink in your sleep &#40;is this wise?&#41;."'
