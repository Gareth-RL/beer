| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale gold with white lace top. Aroma is lightly floral hops but not overwhelmingly so. Bit of citric pith as well. Taste is easy going light sweet. Palate is medium to light body, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a soft finish. Overall a beer you could drink in your sleep &#40;is this wise?&#41;. |
