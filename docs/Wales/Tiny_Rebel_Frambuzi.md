| **Comments** | Keg at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours murky raspberry colour and has a lace halo that lasts. Taste is light to medium sour with some sweetness persistent. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a clammy juice finish. Refreshing overall which was my motivation but not so keen on the palate. |
