Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Keg at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours murky raspberry colour and has
  a lace halo that lasts. Taste is light to medium sour with some sweetness persistent.
  Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a clammy juice finish.
  Refreshing overall which was my motivation but not so keen on the palate.
