Beer: Tiny Rebel Sonic Boom Typhoon
BeerID: 648618
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours golden body and white lace top. Aroma
  has citrus hops and grassy notes on top of pale cereal malt. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and
  a light bitter finish. Overall a reasonable DIPA, but less distinctive than many
  Tiny Rebel beers.
