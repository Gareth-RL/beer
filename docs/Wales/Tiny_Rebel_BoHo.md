| **Comments** | Keg at The Overdraught Nottingham. The problem with tap takeovers for a ticker is that eventually you are left with the beer you have avoided. Pours slightly hazy yellow gold with white top so the lager aficionado won&#39;t approve. Aroma is grassy herbal hop with presumably pale malts behind. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a grainy note and a grassy scent. Palate is medium bodied, sticky for a lager &#40;but this is from someone who recalls lager as having only one virtue no texture at all&#41;, carbonation is average and the finish is vaguely sweet. I can see it selling but never again to me. |
