Comments: '"Cask. Aroma &#40; I worry about a brewer who spells depths as &quot;depts&quot;
  but this has malt on the nose and spicy hops.&#41; Dark fruits and yeast. Pours
  orange amber with thin lace top decent lacing. The taste has hop bitterness entwined
  with soft biscuit. Short finish. The diplomatic term would be understated. The candid
  one is Blah."'
