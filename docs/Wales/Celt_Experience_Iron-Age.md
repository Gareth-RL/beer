Comments: '"Cask. Aroma has mildly berry scent. Pours copper with thin lace top. A
  pleasant balanced bitter with some malt biscuit and hop fruit in each swallow. I
  suspect the art of making a tasty low abv bitter is becoming rarer since the craft
  revolution. But one could share an evening with this beer and still talk sense &#40;assuming
  of course that gibberish was not your native tongue&#41;."'
