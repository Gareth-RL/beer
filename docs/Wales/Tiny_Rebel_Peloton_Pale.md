Comments: Poured golden body with white lace. Aroma citrus lemon dominant, some floral
  notes. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with a honeyed quality. Palate is medium
  to thin bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Easy
  drinking and if it were by someone other than TR I would be more impressed. For
  them, this is average.
