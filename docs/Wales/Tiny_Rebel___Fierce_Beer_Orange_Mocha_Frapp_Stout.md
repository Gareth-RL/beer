Comments: 'Tap at Junkyard. Pours dark black coffee with dark brown halo. Aroma is
  mocha coffee and orange although not overwhelmingly. Not taking my coffee frappe
  I may be disadvantaged. Taste is sweet medium and above. Palate is medium bodied,
  texture sticky to creamy, carbonation soft, and there is long finish. One wonders
  about the division of labour with Fierce who have a  talent for fruit in beer. But
  a very good stout  '
