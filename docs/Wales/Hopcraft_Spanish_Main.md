Comments: '"@Nottingham beer festival. Aroma is caramel, raisin, vanilla, and sweet.
  Pours dark muscavado sugar like with bubbly tan top. Taste is medium sweet and bitter
  with some spice. Palate is medium to full bodied with oily texture flat to soft
  carbonation and a bitter finish. The best of the festival so far."'
