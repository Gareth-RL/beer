Comments: '"An American pale. You know what to expect. The hop scent will be citric
  or more broadly tropical and that will mute the malt scent. Poured golden body thin
  white lace . Medium sweet to bitter with some fruit and a malt finish. Medium bodied
  slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It''s ok but nothing
  to lose your head over."'
