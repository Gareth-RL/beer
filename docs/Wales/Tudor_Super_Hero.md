Overall: 12.0
MyScore: 3.2
Comments: An American pale. You know what to expect. The hop scent will be citric or more broadly tropical and that will mute the malt scent. Poured golden body thin white lace . Medium sweet to bitter with some fruit and a malt finish. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It's ok but nothing to lose your head over.
