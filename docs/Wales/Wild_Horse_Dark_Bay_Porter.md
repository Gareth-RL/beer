Brewer: Wild Horse Brewing Co.
City: Llandudno, Caernarfonshire
Comments: Tap at Crafty Crow. Pours reddish chestnut with off white lace. Aroma has
  dark chocolate and caramel malt evident. Taste is medium to full sweet to sour with
  bitter finale. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel, quite lively carbonation,
  and for me this affected the finish. Overall a good effort at an under used style.
  More London porters are needed.
