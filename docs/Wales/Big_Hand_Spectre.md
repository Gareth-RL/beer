| **Comments** | Pours dark brown almost black with tan bubbly top. Aroma has caramelized malt and coffee, although I have tasted stronger; more filter than espresso. Taste is medium sweet with a lightly sour and bitter finish; maybe even a little saltiness. Palate is medium body, oily feel, flat, with a bitter, finish. Overall a nice one to start the Nottingham beer festival. 26/02/19 second sipping. Cask. Aroma is stronger but otherwise the festival pour was a good guide. |
