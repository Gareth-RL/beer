| **Comments** | Aroma has a medley of fruits - mango mandarin papaya and pineapple to name a few and lychees for the discerning, melon for the rest. Pours hazy golden with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and sour but with a well judged transition. Palate is medium bodied, sticky fruit feel echoing the mango nose, soft to average carbonation and a long light and complex finish that susurates as a good IPA should. Certainly a good standard for others to surpass. |
