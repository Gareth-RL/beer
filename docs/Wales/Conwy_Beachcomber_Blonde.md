Comments: Hand pull. Beer to test my objectivity since I will never be a lager drinker.
  I have 3 sons to do that for me, and one does. But if the pungent smell of lemon
  rind and grapefruit sets your pulse racing this is for you. It’s pale gold with
  a thin top that laces nicely - it might even rival a Sauvignon blanc with fish.
  But this is beer.and once the drinking starts, the hops have a simple bitter message.
  So once the tongue has curled like a squeezed lemon on a sole fillet, there’s not
  a lot to say. One for the summers of one’s youth.
