| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden with lace top that yields broken lacing on the glass. While the aroma had some citrus and grass it was not as pungent as I expected. The preponderance of hop fruits was more evident in the taste. It was just the right ale for watching Mansfield thrash Notts County. |
