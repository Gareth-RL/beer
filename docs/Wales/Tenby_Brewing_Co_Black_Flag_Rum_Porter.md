| **Comments** | Tap @ the Crafty Crow. Aroma has plenty of malt coffee chocolate toffee lurk as does rum and vanilla. Pours brown with a scummy circle of stained lace. Taste is medium sweet with light sourness and bitterness. Carbonation flat to light. Body is similarly scant. But finish is lasting. I guess I expected more. |
