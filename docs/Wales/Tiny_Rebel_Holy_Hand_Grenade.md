Comments: '"Poured murky full pulp orange juice. Aroma is predictably citric fruit.
  Taste follows the same line medium sweet to sour then bitter finish but there''s
  a background chalkiness that seems to happen with these NEIPA s. Palate is medium
  bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter chalky finish. Pity.
  The finish spoiled the play."'
