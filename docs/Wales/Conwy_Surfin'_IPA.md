| **Comments** | There’s a grapefruit aroma but not as pungent as some. There’s a golden body with a nice white cap that laces down. And there’s a pink grapefruit taste in the first swallow that confirms your nose still works and I agree that on a hot day it slakes the thirst but there it ends. This is a step above lager and a step below pale ale in complexity. I confess that my prejudices for the malty range of spectrum is confirmed by moments like this. |
