Comments: '"@nottingham beer festival. A disaster. Virtually no aroma except a hint
  of the chili. Appearance should have warned&#045;&#045;murky muddy brown. Taste
  had little that could be beer related but there was chili. Consequently the watery
  palate left a residue of spice that was not pleasant. Overall, I can only conclude
  that this was not ready to be served but it was barely fit for human consumption.
  I have sampled others from this brewery so an aberration."'
