| **Comments** | Aroma has peaches and lactic murk. Poured hazy golden with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with lasting fruitiness and a milky backnote do apt to the label. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long fruit finish. I wish I had had it at the beach this summer. |
