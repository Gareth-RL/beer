| **Comments** | Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden with thin white lace top. Aroma has biscuit malt and lightly citric hops. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter definitely a sweeter pale. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, and a sweet finish. The image of farmers in wellies drinking craft pale ale will linger, but it is still good stuff 😊. |
