Beer: Tiny Rebel Urban IPA
BeerID: 172163
Brewer: Tiny Rebel
City: Rogerstone, Newport
Comments: Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden with thin white lace
  top. Aroma has biscuit malt and lightly citric hops. Taste is medium sweet and lightly
  bitter definitely a sweeter pale. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average
  to soft carbonation, and a sweet finish. The image of farmers in wellies drinking
  craft pale ale will linger, but it is still good stuff ðŸ˜Š.
