| **Comments** | Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops. Pours clear amber brown body with white lace speckled top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with good maltiness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A very decent bitter where balance does not produce blandness. |
