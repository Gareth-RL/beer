Brewer: Tenby Brewing Co
City: Tenby, Pembrokeshire
Comments: Tap. Aroma cereal, bread, dough, slick of Coopers marmalade. Pours orange
  amber with white foam top . Taste heavy cloying sweetness, That descended to a lightly
  sour finish. I don’t trust my nose in beer matters which is a major impediment but
  even if this is no more than a Madeleine to marmalade it’s better than the three
  cask ales I tried before. PS. That does not make it good.
