Comments: Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma is Mosaic hops I.e grapefruit
  with herbal pine notes. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white foam top. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly sour. Palate is creamy texture, medium bodied at most, soft carbonation,
  and a soft light sour finish. All I can add is that it sold out.
