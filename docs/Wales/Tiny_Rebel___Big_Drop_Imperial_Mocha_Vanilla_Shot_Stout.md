| **Comments** | Aroma has the chocolate edge of mocha and vanilla extract. Pours black with tan lace top. Taste is medium to full sweet with chocolate over coffee over vanilla. Pretty sweet with a bitter backnote. Palate is the tell. Thin to medium, definitely watery, which stouts can be but imperial isn't.  Texture don't have enough cling. May explain why carbonation feels flat with bubbles in the finish, which is surprisingly long. (And only then did I detect the coffee - smell the coffee as they say). So apart from palate, this is remarkable. Inadvertently second sipped 01/07/2019. Still impressed by everything but the palate. |
