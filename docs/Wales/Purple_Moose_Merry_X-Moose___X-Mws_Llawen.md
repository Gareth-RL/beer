Comments: '"Bottle. Drunk on my return after a Xmas away. Poured dark chestnut brown
  with thin broken lacing. Aroma was modest: some roasted malt and maybe a hint of
  spice. Taste was medium sweet with a tang of licorice. Medium bodied at most, smooth
  texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Decent enough without ever becoming
  a beer I would seek out."'
