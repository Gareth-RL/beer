Brewer: Hopcraft Brewing
City: Pontyclun
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy golden body white foam top.
  Aroma has honey and floral lemon notes. Taste is medium bitter wrapped in a light
  honeyed sweetness. Palate is medium bodied,sticky texture, average to soft carbonation,
  a herbal hop finish. Bizarre but tasty and probably the bleakest beer title ever
  for a father of four.
