| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy golden body white foam top. Aroma has honey and floral lemon notes. Taste is medium bitter wrapped in a light honeyed sweetness. Palate is medium bodied,sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, a herbal hop finish. Bizarre but tasty and probably the bleakest beer title ever for a father of four. |
