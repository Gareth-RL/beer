Comments: '"Cask. Aroma hay, floral, citrus, grass, leaves. Pours golden yellow with
  full foam top &#40;courtesy of a new barmaid&#41;. Taste medium sweet thanks to
  the citrus hops. Sour finish. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation with slightly
  slick finish. I think I might move to Wales."'
