Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: De Eeuwige Jeugd Bokkelul
BeerID: 563448
Brewer: Brouwerij De Eeuwige Jeugd
City: Amsterdam
Comments: Bottle. Pours reddish amber body, off white lace top diminishing to loose
  broken coating. Aroma is predominantly malt, roasted with toffee notes, but there
  is another fruit note, maybe fig. Taste is medium sweet with the toffee nutty qualities
  foregrounded, but it then sours through a herbal grassy note to a bitter finish.
  Palate is medium bodied, slightly sticky feel, average to soft carbonation, and
  a light bitter finish. I see that this has been categorized as Doppelbock, although
  it could be brown ale for all I know. At least I know what type of beer to order
  should I ever get the chance to visit Amsterdam in these times of limited travel.
  Note the surge in reviews from 2018 when it was in a Beer52 bundle.
