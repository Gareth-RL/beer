Beer: Emelisse Espresso Stout
BeerID: 112198
Brewer: Brouwerij Emelisse (Slot Oostende)
City: Goes
Comments: Poured dark brown with little or no head maybe the thinnest of tan halos.
  Aroma has coffee although it is not an espresso my Italian friends would relish.
  Taste is medium sweet with a licorice bitterness thereafter. Dusty finish. Palate
  is medium, oily texture and soft to average carbonation. A hint of heat in the finish.
  I guess it is enhanced by the coffee beans but not an imperial that impressed me.
  But these days things rarely do.
