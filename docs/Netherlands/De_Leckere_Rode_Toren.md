| **Comments** | I continue my preliminary probe of Bock, even if the phrase bottom fermenting is still a gift to English comedians of a certain vintage. This one pours reddish brown chestnut with diminishing lacing. The nose has the prescribed maltiness but it is more nutty than caramel to my senses. The taste is not as sweet as some but it does persist so there is no great transition from medium sweetness to anything else and yes, I guess there is a toffee note in the mouth, even if it wasn't there in the scent. Palate is a bit rough, even if it would be classed as medium bodied with average carbonation; this is not a smooth drink. I am moving to the conclusion that I am a Dunkler Bock kinda guy even if I prefer them less robust than this even in what the brewer alludes to as the harsh months. And as this is 2020 few months escape that label. |
