Comments: '"Pours murky reddish brown with scummy off-white top. Aroma of cocoa and
  roasted sweet malts. Taste is predictably sweet but with a hoppy finish which doesn''t
  quite blend with the cocoa powder. Palate is medium bodied. slight sticky feel,
  average to soft carbonation and a bitter yet cocoa powdery finish.  I wonder what
  it would taste like without the cocoa. Decent enough"'
