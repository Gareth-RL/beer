Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Bronckhorster Nightporter
BeerID: 137655
Brewer: Bronckhorster Brewing Company
City: Rha
Comments: Dark flat cola body with thin diminishing tan top. Aroma has light smoke,
  chocolate malt and licorice notes. There is some peat here but not enough to distract.
  The taste is more salt licorice with a bitter tang. Palate is medium bodied smooth
  texture average to fine carbonation and a long finish. It carries its 8% easily
  and is a smooth rewarding porter; probably the best of my recent purchases so I
  will look for others by the same company. Certainly one of the better Dutch beers
  that I have tried.
