| **Comments** | Bottle foamed out on opening then settled to a chestnut amber body with thin scummy lacing and quite a lot of sediment. Aroma is yeasty and malty with some spice and toffee. Taste is medium sweet with not much else. Palate is medium as well but sticky despite the lively carbonation. The finish is still sweet and this gives it a rather bland quality. Not impressed. |
