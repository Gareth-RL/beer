Beer: Texels Noorderwiend
BeerID: 239985
Brewer: Texelse Bierbrouwerij (Heineken)
City: Oudeschild
Comments: Bottle foamed out on opening then settled to a chestnut amber body with
  thin scummy lacing and quite a lot of sediment. Aroma is yeasty and malty with some
  spice and toffee. Taste is medium sweet with not much else. Palate is medium as
  well but sticky despite the lively carbonation. The finish is still sweet and this
  gives it a rather bland quality. Not impressed.
