Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Uiltje F*ck The Christmas Tree Is On Fire
BeerID: 246580
Brewer: Uiltje Brewing Company (Swinkels Family Brewers)
City: Haarlem
Comments: Aroma has dark malts, some coffee some caramel but with a boozy whiff. Pours
  dark brown almost black with tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with
  some alcohol heat building. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average
  carbonation, and an alcoholic finish. Slightly disappointed because I had previously
  tasted the excellent Apfelstrudel, but it is still a good stout, just below excellent.
