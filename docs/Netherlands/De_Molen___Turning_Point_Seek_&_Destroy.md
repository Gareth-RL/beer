Comments: '"Honey nutmeg vanilla cinnamon and cacao are among the additions to this
  stout. Several are evident in the scent nutmeg cinnamon and even honey greeted my
  nose. It pours black with thin tan lace top. The medley does rather confuse the
  taste buds with the spices jingling with the honey and cocoa. For me the vanilla
  was swamped and even the chocolate was muted. But if spiced stout is your thing,
  enjoy. The same applies to palate. Medium to full bodied sticky to clammy feel as
  the honey seems to smooth things but it does render the finish a bit of a car crash.
  I still rate it 4:5 because I appreciate that the alcohol is well managed in terms
  of heat. Maybe they are warming up for Xmas with the spices and cocoa."'
