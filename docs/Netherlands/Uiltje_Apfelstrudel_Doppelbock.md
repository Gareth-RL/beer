Beer: Uiltje Apfelstrudel Doppelbock
BeerID: 554103
Brewer: Uiltje Brewing Company (Swinkels Family Brewers)
City: Haarlem
Comments: Aroma has stewed and fresh apples alongside toffee and cinnamon. Pours reddish
  brown with thin lace. Taste is sweet with strong apple sauce and a crumble rather
  than strudel pastry taste (but that may just be my lack of sophistication). Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long fruit finish
  with a hint of spice. It works for me.
