Beer: La Trappe Quadrupel
BeerID: 4565
Brewer: Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven - La Trappe Trappist
City: Berkel-Enschot
Comments: Bottle. Aroma fruity but raisins dates not fresh. An alcoholic pungency.
  Pours cloudy amber with some white bubbly lace. Taste is caramelized malts, vanilla
  sugars and dark fruits. Alongside this is a full bodied presence on the palate that
  coats the tongue and quite possibly blurs the vision. Like a brandy after a fine
  meal, this finishes everything. For that reason alone I am relieved not all beer
  is like this but I still wish more could be.
