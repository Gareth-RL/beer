| **Comments** | Poured black body with tan cream lace diminishing to halo. Aroma has malt bread, molasses and caramel. Taste is medium sweet with chocolate and toffee giving way to a bitter finish. Some spice and liquorice. Palate is medium to full body, smooth texture, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. The texture is particularly impressive and overall it's as rich an imperial as an afternoon tipple can manage. |
