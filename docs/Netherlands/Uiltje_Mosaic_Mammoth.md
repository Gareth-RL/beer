Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 8.0
Beer: Uiltje Mosaic Mammoth
BeerID: 611026
Brewer: Uiltje Brewing Company (Swinkels Family Brewers)
City: Haarlem
Comments: 440ml can. Poured a decidedly murky orange with scummy off white lace. Aroma
  is strongly tropical hops mango and pineapple and grapefruit predominate for me.
  Taste is medium sweet with dank juicy fruits to the fore transiting to a lighter
  souring bitterness in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, average
  carbonation and a light bitter finish with not the classic chalky finish that I
  have come to associate with NEIPA. An old can by the looks of things with an expiration
  at the end of the month. I caught it just in time.
