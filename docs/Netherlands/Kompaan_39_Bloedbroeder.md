| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body with tan lace top. Aroma has roasted malts with coffee and chocolate notes and little berry fruit. Taste is medium sweet but with a drying licorice bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, at most, some stickiness, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Like others I cannot detect the port in either the scent or the taste but would dub this a porter rather than a stout in overall feel. It clearly has fans out there but I was less than overwhelmed. |
