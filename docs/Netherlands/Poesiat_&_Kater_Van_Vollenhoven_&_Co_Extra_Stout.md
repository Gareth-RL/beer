| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with tan lace fading to halo. My bottle behaved so the chalice filled without becoming entirely foam; this can happen! Aroma is emphatically malty with roasted coffee and chocolate notes - the latter on the powdered cocoa side. Taste is briefly sweet but lastingly and drying bitter. Some licorice comes through amidst earthy malt. Palate is medium bodied, smooth to oily feel, soft to average carbonation, and a long finish. My exploration of Dutch stout continues and overall, they seem solid enough although most have been extra or imperial and many have been dry rather than sweet and licorice rather than caramel malts. It is a step up from Guinness in the bottle. |
