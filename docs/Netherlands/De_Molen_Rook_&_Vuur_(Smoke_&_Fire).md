| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma is like walking into an osteria, cured meats and cheeses with smokehouse effect. Pours black like flat cola with tan froth that fades fast. Taste is medium sweet till the chilies pull you back to centre. Smoke yes, but thankfully no fire. A brew to try again younger as this bottle was 1/04/15. |
