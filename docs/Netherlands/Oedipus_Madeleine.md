Beer: Oedipus Madeleine
BeerID: 659867
Brewer: Oedipus (Heineken)
City: Amsterdam
Comments: Poured dark chestnut body with tan foaming top. Aroma of roasted malt with
  date/fig notes. Taste is medium sweet with some hop fruit evident in the light bitter
  finish. Palate is medium bodied, average carbonation,  grainy texture, and this
  gives a slight flour quality to the finish. The malty bocks seem to suit me but
  I can see that this is nothing special.
