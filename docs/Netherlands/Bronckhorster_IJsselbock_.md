| **Comments** | Pours a dark brown body with tan foam, lots of it. Aroma is emphatically malt-loafed. Taste is medium sweet with a dried fruit quality. Texture is medium bodied, high carbonation, oily feel, and a fruity finish. I think I could drink more Bock if they edge towards English porter. |
