| **Comments** | Aroma has dark malt with light cherry note. Pours black with tan halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with an emphasis on the sweet as the fruit and cream kick in. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long finish with some coffee remaining. Overall good but the least of three tried. |
