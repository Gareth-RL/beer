Beer: Kompaan 20 Bondgenoot
BeerID: 176090
Brewer: Kompaan
City: The Hague
Comments: Poured golden amber body and off white lace top mostly diminishing. Aroma
  has bready malt and spicy herbal hops. Taste is light to medium sweetness  but this
  fades to a hoppy bitter finish with the herbal note dominant and some yeast. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, average to high carbonation, clammy feel and bitter
  finish. Perfectly drinkable but also relatively anonymous.
