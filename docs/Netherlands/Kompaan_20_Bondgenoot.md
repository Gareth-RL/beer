| **Comments** | Poured golden amber body and off white lace top mostly diminishing. Aroma has bready malt and spicy herbal hops. Taste is light to medium sweetness  but this fades to a hoppy bitter finish with the herbal note dominant and some yeast. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to high carbonation, clammy feel and bitter finish. Perfectly drinkable but also relatively anonymous. |
