Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Hertog Jan Grand Prestige
BeerID: 5305
Brewer: Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev)
City: Arcen
Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body with tan lace top mainly lasting. Aroma
  has spice, dark fruits, and some caramel malt. The taste is medium sweet because
  of the fruit and the alcohol heat seems to heighten the spice notes that hint at
  German gingerbread biscuits. The palate is medium bodied with a slick mouth coating
  feel, soft to average carbonation and a spice finish. Overall, it seemed a reasonable
  Quadrupel, and maybe I should have allowed it to mature in the bottle till next
  Christmas. Maybe 2020 is my year for drinking more Belgian beer; I remain embarrassing
  inexperienced for a man who likes his ales.
