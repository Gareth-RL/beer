| **Comments** | Aroma signals smoked status with a hint of tea. Poured light brown body with a thin lace top. Taste is mildly sweet to lightly smoked ash with some background malt. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation, with a smoky finish. Still not wedded to the style but good enough. |
