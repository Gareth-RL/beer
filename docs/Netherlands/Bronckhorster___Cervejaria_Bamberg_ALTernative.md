Beer: Bronckhorster / Cervejaria Bamberg ALTernative
BeerID: 383070
Brewer: Bronckhorster Brewing Company
City: Rha
Comments: Aroma signals smoked status with a hint of tea. Poured light brown body
  with a thin lace top. Taste is mildly sweet to lightly smoked ash with some background
  malt. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation, with a
  smoky finish. Still not wedded to the style but good enough.
