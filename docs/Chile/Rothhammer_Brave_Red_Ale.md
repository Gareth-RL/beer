| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours hazy amber body thin lace. Aroma has caramel, bread, nuts, in the malts  herbal and yeasty for the rest. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a toffee tang. Palate is medium bodied, sticky, average carbonation, bitter, finish. I&#39;d no expectations and they were met. |
