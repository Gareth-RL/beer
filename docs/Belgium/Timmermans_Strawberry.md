| **Comments** | Tap. Pours raspberry with foamy top. Aroma is strongly strawberry in a way icecream is but the fruit isn&#39;t and little else penetrated this artificial fragrance. Taste is similarly hyper sweet and fairly relentless. Palate is medium to light body sticky texture average carbonation and a sugary residue. As a drink in the garden on a sunny afternoon this could work for some, but it is barely bet.   |
