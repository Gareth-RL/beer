Comments: '"Tap. Pours raspberry with foamy top. Aroma is strongly strawberry in a
  way icecream is but the fruit isn&#39;t and little else penetrated this artificial
  fragrance. Taste is similarly hyper sweet and fairly relentless. Palate is medium
  to light body sticky texture average carbonation and a sugary residue. As a drink
  in the garden on a sunny afternoon this could work for some, but it is barely bet.  "'
