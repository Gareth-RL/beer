Comments: 'Bottle from One for the Road Mestre. Poured dark body tan cream lace top.
  Aroma of yeasty malts with dark fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some caramel
  some salt that sours the finish. Palate is medium bodied at most, mouth coating
  texture combined with average carbonation and a not pleasant sour tang finish. Not
  for me. '
