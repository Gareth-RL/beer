| **Comments** | Poured golden bodied with white lace diminishing. Aroma has lemon rind and yeast. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit pastille notes. Palate is medium, slightly grainy texture, high carbonation, and a bitter finish. With the rain pouring outside on an April grey day, it is hardly the season for a Saison but this seems to capture the balance of the generic elements. Perhaps a slightly longer bitter finish than some. |
