Brewer: Brasserie de la Senne

Comments: 'Poured golden body white foam top.  Aroma has some yeast and hop fruitiness
  more apricot than berries.  Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a soft
  finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a lingering
  bitter finish.  The first from a box of 16 from Beerwulf aimed at filling in the
  gaps of beers drunk before but not rated in the distant years of my youth. This
  one seems likely to set the average since it tasted fine but unremarkable. '
