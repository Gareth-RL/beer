Comments: Bottle. Aroma citrus, ginger with a definite zing. Pours pale gold with
  white foam top. Broken lacing. Taste gas bubble gum yeast and lemon notes. A refreshing
  beer with the possibility of drinking several which is less feasible with its Trappist
  brethren. Light body with some soft residue on the palate at the end. Mildly irritating
  like autocorrect to American English.
