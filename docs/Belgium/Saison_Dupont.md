Beer: Saison Dupont
BeerID: 5386
Brewer: Brasserie Dupont
City: Tourpes-Leuze
Comments: Bottle at the Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours a murky unfiltered orange
  gold body with white foam top. Aroma has bread, cereal, malts with floral, herbs,
  cheese, notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture, average carbonation, and a long finish but not a climactic one.
  I assume this is a familiar case of an original brew being supplanted by its imitators.
  Certainly I have had Saison of equal or better quality.
