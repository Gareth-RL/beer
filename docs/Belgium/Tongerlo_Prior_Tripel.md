| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured clear pale golden body full foaming white top. The aroma is certainly floral. Taste is lemon and grapefruit with a peppery back note. Medium sweet to bitter with the spiciness evident in the finish. Medium bodied, drying in the mouth, average + carbonation, and a spice finish. I am not a great Tripel drinker and if I had spotted the 9% I might have waited to share the bottle. Still it is pleasant and refreshing |
