Brewer: Brouwerij De Ranke
City: Dottignies
Comments: Bottle. Poured pale amber with white lace foam and yeast spotting. Lightly
  sweet to medium bitter with a bit of a grapefruit tang on the way to a dry finish.
  This Belgian take on English bitter is decidedly bitter and hoppy. Medium bodied
  grainy texture average+ carbonation sharpening bitter finish. Not the session beer
  for me
