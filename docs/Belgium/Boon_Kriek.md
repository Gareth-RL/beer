| **Comments** | I see this more often bottled than on tap and that has postponed my rating. Emphatically cherry scent. Pours purple cherry with ephemeral lacing. Taste is far sweeter than one might expect and it softens but never surrenders. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long finish. A posh alcopop. |
