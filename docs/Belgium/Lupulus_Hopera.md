Comments: '"Bottle.  Poured hazy orange golden body with white foam top.  Aroma has
  citrusy hops and bread malts.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with both
  fruit and grainy notes evident.  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to
  full carbonation and a bitter finish.  If this were not a Belgian beer by a Belgian
  brewer I might be more generous but it is and it is uninspired. That said,  it''s
  not undrinkable by any means. "'
