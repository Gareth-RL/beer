| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours orange golden body and foam lace top. Aroma has banana from the yeast, toasted malts and some herbal floral hops. Taste is medium to full sweetness and for some that will be a delight and others will be dismayed. It certainly predominates. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, lively carbonation, and a light sour finish. It may attract a younger and female clientele but it won&#39;t recruit an old fossil like me. |
