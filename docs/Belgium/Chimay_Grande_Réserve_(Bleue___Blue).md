| **Comments** | 33cl bottle while in Italy. Aroma is dark malts and yeast and spice. Looks good. Dark body that reddens when held to the light; creamy lace top with some yeast spots. Taste is medium sweet with dark fruits and some sour spiciness. Texture is medium bodied with a slightly granular texture with average carbonation and a long finish. The mouthfeel complements the complexity of the taste. I am still filling in my scorecard of Belgian beers drunk before but never rated. I should probably have allowed one to age a little as the aroma from this was good without being great and the taste was complex but rather diffuse; the sour notes did not blend with the rest. It remains a beer that deserves revisiting and respect. |
