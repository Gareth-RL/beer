Brewer: Haacht
City: Boortmeerbeek
Comments: Bottle. Modest scent coriander and lightly floral. Poured pale gold with
  full white foam lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with lemon tang. Medium
  bodied, mouth coating texture, average carbonation, and mineral finish. I am not
  a huge fan of the Belgian white ale; I prefer the German. But this is inoffensive
