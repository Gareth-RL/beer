| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours amber body thick white lace. Aroma resinous pine with hints of grapefruit pith. Taste is briefly sweet, but lengthening bitter: some caramel malt, some pine notes, but alas some industrial soap in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and sadly a soap finish. All was going well until the first swallow. Obviously IPAs are not their thing. What is? |
