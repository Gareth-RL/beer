Comments: '"Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Odd for a beer that boasts of re-fermentation
  in the bottle. Pours rich golden brown with white foam top. Aroma has berry fruits
  and caramel malt and bewilderingly a hint of egg. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to full carbonation &#40;a sip finishes
  with some fizz&#41;. Finish itself is softly bitter. Presumably better bottled."'
