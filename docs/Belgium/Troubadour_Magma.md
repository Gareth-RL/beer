| **Comments** | Poured lightly hazed amber off white lace with some yeast spots. Aroma of citrus hops and caramel malt. Medium sweet with toffee and citrus fruit unusually combined. The transition is barely perceptible and the fruit comes back in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation (I would have liked softer), and a complex fruit malt finish. Part of me wishes that the same effects could be achieved in a Dubbel. But that's what 1/3 is for. Totally tapped has ceased brewing but has a taphouse bar in Beeston with excellent stuff. |
