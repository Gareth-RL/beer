| **Comments** | Can from Aldi supermarket in Mestre. Poured orange gold body foam white top. Aroma is caramel malt, banana, and spice. Taste is medium sweet or maybe a little more; the roast malts hold the fort. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation for canned beer, and a lightly spiced finish. Part of my campaign to rate European beers that I know I have tried in the past but never somehow put on here. Plus, given the way prices are going, a 33cl can for 1.69 euro seemed a fair deal even for the corporate mega-breweries. Having said that, this is no more than okay for a Belgian pale, and my memory of it having tasted better may stem from the low level of competition back in the day. Haven't seen Leffe in can before. |
