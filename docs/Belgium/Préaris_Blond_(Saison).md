BeerID: 176890
Brewer: Vliegende Paard Brouwers
City: Oedelem
Comments: Poured cloudy hazy golden body with full foam white top. Hoppy nose with
  some yeast and herbal spice. Medium sweet to bitter with a hint of citrus but more
  yeasty spice, especially in the finish. Light to medium bodied, grainy texture,
  average carbonation for a bottled beer, and a spice finish. Still finding my way
  with Saison beers, but this is palatable enough
