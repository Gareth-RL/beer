Brewer: Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel Moortgat)
City: Antwerpen
Comments: 'Poured clear golden body thin lace. Aroma has yeasty notes alongside  apricot
  and spice and light toffee malts. Taste is sweet fruit jelly initially mellowing
  to a dusty bitterness. Whatever the opposite of crispness is, this has it. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I agree with
  those who feel it drinks easily for a Tripel and equally those who find it rather
  uninspired.  Given the rough handling by the delivery company I was relieved that
  a bottle fermenting beer did not erupt on opening but I was expecting some complexity
  in taste and texture whereas the most here is found in the scent. '
