Comments: Aroma has fruit lemon zest and lactose indicating sour or wild properties.
  Pours hazy golden thin open lace halo. Taste is fruity but ultimately sour. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a sour finish. Tbh I drank it
  to up my disgracefully low Belgian intake, and it failed to incentivize.
