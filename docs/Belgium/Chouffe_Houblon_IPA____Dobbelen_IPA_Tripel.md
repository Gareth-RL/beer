Comments: '"Poured golden body with fading loose white foam lacing. Aroma is spicy,
  hoppy with pale malt notes. Taste is medium bitterness with a pleasant languor.
  Palate is medium to light body with a definite tang, carbonation average and lasting
  bitter taste. I have drunk it before and never pondered the puzzle of its categorisation:
  is it a Belgian Tripel or an international IPA? The entry here even has Saison mentioned.
  Further proof that the generic terms are imprecise and perhaps it is more important
  to consider whether you like the taste! As a man more drawn to the malty side of
  the beer spectrum, I drink IPAs in moderation and appreciate them as beers ideal
  for the summer: refreshing and for me preferable to lager. I suspect the Danish
  front-runners might want to revisit their 2006 rates, but it is still deserving
  of its status."'
