| **Comments** | Poured a ruby chestnut body with tan foam diminishing rapidly to uneven lacing with conspicuous yeasty spots. Aroma is dark malt with strong spicy character and sugary candy rather than fruit note. Taste is medium sweet to sour as the roasted malts transit to sour grain. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to soft carbonation, and a sour finish. Not impressed by the finish. This seems a case of a high volume beer sustaining a high average through export to the non-discerning drinker (twas ever thus). It serves me right for having drunk Belgian beers in the past with barely a glance and certainly not a rating. I am retracing my steps and currently hitting all the spots I would have preferred to leave behind me. |
