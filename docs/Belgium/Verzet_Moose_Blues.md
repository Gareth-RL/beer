Comments: '"Bottle. Poured a murky hazy brown body with off white lacing diminishing
  to a halo. Some roasted malt notes and yeastiness in the scent. Taste is medium
  sweet with maybe a background glimmer of chocolate as the sip recedes. There''s
  certainly some fruit in there as well although the malts dominate. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. But the finish is eclipsed
  by the sweet beginning. Generally I am someone who loves his malts more than his
  hops so in scent and taste this should be my kind of beer, but the overall effect
  is less than the sum of its parts. Certainly the chocolate is not there enough to
  be worth the tag. And the finish is more a falling away than a crescendo. This moose
  is too loose."'
