Beer: Omer Vander Ghinste Brasserie LeFort Tripel
BeerID: 418825
Brewer: Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor)
City: Bellegem
Comments: Pours pale golden with white foam diminishing to spotted lacing. Aroma is
  hop fruits and yeast esters with definite banana note. Taste is medium to high sweetness
  edging candied or pear drop, settling to light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture, medium to high carbonation, and a light bitter finish but it cannot
  shake the wine-gum candy note. I had not expected this Tripel to be an alco-pop.
  I can imagine my unsuspecting younger self drinking several of these on a summer
  night and wondering why my head throbbed the next morning. Ah those were the days?
  or were they?
