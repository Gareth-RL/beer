| **Comments** | Tap @ Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours murky red purple with thin lace. Aroma is lightly fruity and vanilla but not overly so for a fruit beer&#033; Taste is medium sweet with slight medicinal finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a herbal finish. I sometimes wonder about Belgian beer some wonders and some blunders. |
