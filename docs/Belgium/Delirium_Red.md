Comments: '"Tap @ Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours murky red purple with thin lace.
  Aroma is lightly fruity and vanilla but not overly so for a fruit beer&#033; Taste
  is medium sweet with slight medicinal finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture,
  average carbonation, and a herbal finish. I sometimes wonder about Belgian beer
  some wonders and some blunders."'
