| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma of fermenting apples . Pours clear amber body with rapidly diminishing thin head. Taste is medium to heavy sweet to sour, may well testify to the &quot;addition of candisyrup &#40;sic&#41; before bottling.&quot; Palate is light to medium body, texture sticky, carbonation soft to flat, and the finish is less a linger more a stain. Overall, another beer type that will need to win me over. |
