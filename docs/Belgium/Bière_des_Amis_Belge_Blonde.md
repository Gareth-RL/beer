| **Comments** | Bottle from Beers of Europe. Poured slightly cloudy golden with loose white lace. Aroma of yeast and hop but still light. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter a little fruit initially but pretty bland overall. Medium bodied, smooth but gassy, and a bitter finish. I drank it to forget the previous German experiment but this one too is not a beer to seek out. |
