Beer: Bière des Amis Belge Blonde
BeerID: 704902
Brewer: Neobulles
City: Herve
Comments: Bottle from Beers of Europe. Poured slightly cloudy golden with loose white
  lace. Aroma of yeast and hop but still light. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter
  a little fruit initially but pretty bland overall. Medium bodied, smooth but gassy,
  and a bitter finish. I drank it to forget the previous German experiment but this
  one too is not a beer to seek out.
