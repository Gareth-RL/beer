| **Comments** | Bottle; the last in a Haacht box received as a Xmas gift. Poured pale amber with a lasting white foam head. Aroma of herbal hop and yeasty banana. Taste is medium sweet with a more definite banana tang for me and maybe a hint of vanilla, and if you concentrate, coriander in the finish. Light to medium bodied, slightly dusty in the mouth, drying finish. First, it must be conceded that this is better than their Primus lager. Second, as a Belgian single pale ale, it is not too strong, and finally, it is easy drinking. |
