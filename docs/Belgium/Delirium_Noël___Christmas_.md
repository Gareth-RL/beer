| **Comments** | I guess May 4 is time to drink my Christmas beer. Poured dark chestnut amber body and full foam off-white top that could be scooped away with a paddle. Aroma of spices, dried fruits, and yeast. Medium sweet to strongly bitter; in fact overall it's the long bitter finish that stays with me as I was expecting it to be hot in alcohol terms but otherwise sweet and spicy. Certainly a classic but one I am happy to have once a year. 03/12/24 this year I  am starting earlier. Same rating  |
