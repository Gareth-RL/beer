Palate: 4.0
Overall: 14.0
MyScore: 3.6
Comments: Bottle from Beers of Europe. One of a dozen I bought to assess the Belgian Xmas beer tradition and boost my disgracefully low Belgian total. It pours murky amber with loose off-white lace that hints at the yeasts still working as you sip.The aroma has toffee malt, nutmeg and esters. The taste has  more fruit cake notes but with citrus peel coming into the equation and then quite a long dry bitter finish that hints at grapefruit pith. Medium bodied, smooth texture average carbonation (for a bottle), and a long bitter finish. If I am honest, (an opening that says too much), I chose this one because it was the lowest abv of the bunch. Despite the intimidating scorn of the Scandinavian connoisseurs, and the usual sense that what I drink in 2023 the real raters has back in the Noughties, I quite liked it.
