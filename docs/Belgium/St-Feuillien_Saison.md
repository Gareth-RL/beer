Beer: St-Feuillien Saison
BeerID: 101851
Brewer: Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart
City: Le Roeulx
Comments: Bottle. Aroma has herbs, dough, banana,  so the hops and the yeast have
  beaten the malt into submission. My glass was a clear if fizzy golden colour and
  had briefly possessed a bubbly foam top that sped back to the farm. I await a rich
  nuance as promised by their marketing people. But as it stands, it is good, without
  being great. The taste is light sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, and maybe
  even a hint of umami somewhere. So I will take that as nuance. The palate is  medium
  body, slick feel, average carbonation, and all important long finish, that is like
  white noise in the immersion tank. If this is what you look for in a saison, then
  seize it.
