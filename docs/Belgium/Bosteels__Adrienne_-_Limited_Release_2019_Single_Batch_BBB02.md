| **Comments** | Poured very yellow pale, clear with full white lace top. Grassy lemony scent. Taste is similarly citric but with a slight sherbet undernote so that the initial taste is sweeter. Short finish. Palate is medium to thin, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation with a short sour/bitter finish. I was not wowed by elder-flower but then I don't seek it in a beer. I have to admit that my Belgian quotient isn't that high either and tends towards the darker and more robust ones so this plain pale rather pales by comparison |
