MyScore: 3.5
Comments: Poured black body tan lace top. Aroma caramel malt and floral hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more toffee and a smooth transition to a hoppy finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. This was better than I expected. But then drinking an Irish stout made by a Brussels brewer as an Englishman in Italy is apt to be surprising
