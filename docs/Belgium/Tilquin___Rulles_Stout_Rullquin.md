| **Comments** | Oh my. Not stout but a sour and a funky one. The most pleasant scent in the aroma is possibly cherries. The body is reddish chestnut with lasting off white lace. The taste is medium sweet to sour with tart spicy herbal notes. Palate is light to medium bodied drying mouth feel some mineral notes in the finish. It will not draw me back.  |
