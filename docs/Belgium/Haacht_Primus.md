Beer: Haacht Primus
BeerID: 3947
Brewer: Haacht
City: Boortmeerbeek
Comments: Bottle. Poured clear pale golden body with a lasting white foam top. Limited
  aroma that some would describe as delicate and others as nondescript lager. Taste
  is lightly sweet, souring to bitter, and then the industrial soapiness kicks in.
  Palate is light watery texture average carbonation and alas a soapy finish. It is
  easy to be a snob about industrial lagers, but it is also essential.
