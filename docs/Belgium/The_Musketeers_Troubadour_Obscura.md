| **Comments** | Aroma of light chocolate, a little wood smoke and a hint of caramel. I poured into my chalice glass with trepidation as the foam massed. It can produce quite a mountain of creamy tan foam lacing atop its dark brown body with ruby lights. Taste is medium sweet with some red fruits amidst the caramel malt. This smooths into a pleasing bitter finish. Palate is medium, sticky feel, average carbonation and a long finish which is bitter but with a lasting impression of the malts that preceded it. And the abv is very well concealed. I have developed the habit of reading the top raters and this is clearly a beer that is well loved in Scandinavia and appreciated less consistently in the UK. I guess I must have Viking blood. |
