Comments: '"Belgian beer mainstay. Surprised I haven''t reviewed before. Light hoppy
  aroma edging towards fruitiness.  Pours pale golden with ample white foam diminishing
  but enduring.  Taste is lightly  sweet and lastingly butter. Palate is medium to
  light bodied and despite average to full carbonation in the bottle it retains a
  smooth feel and a crisp finish. If I was choosing a mainstream  beer to illustrate
  the type- this would be my Belgian pale ale."'
