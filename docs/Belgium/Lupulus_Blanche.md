BeerID: 507819
Brewer: Lupulus
City: Courtil
Comments: Poured hazy golden body with white top. Light wheat aroma but not in the
  German yeasty style. Taste is medium sweet lightly coriander and a bitter finish.
  Nonetheless bland stuff. Palate is light, carbonation is soft and the feel is sticky.
  Not a wheat beer I will look out for.
