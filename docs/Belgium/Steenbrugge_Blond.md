Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Steenbrugge Blond
BeerID: 85695
Brewer: Brouwerij Palm (Swinkels Family Brewers)
City: Steenhuffel, Londerzeel
Comments: Bottle for Birragogo Milan. Poured clear orange amber body with thin diminishing
  lace. Aroma has definite yeast spice and herbal notes. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter but the pear drop quality lingers. Texture is light to medium bodied
  and somewhat plasticky despite above average carbonation. I am still trying to get
  my head around Belgian beer, especially the abbey style and I can see its charm
  but it seems to a novice that the secondary fermentation in the bottle is likely
  to produce a less than standard experience as the brand travels globally (e.g here
  in Italy where currently it is 30degrees +)
