Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 8.0
Beer: Het Anker Gouden Carolus Classic
BeerID: 4637
Brewer: Brouwerij Het Anker
City: Mechelen
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark chestnut body with thick tan cream lace top. Aroma has
  caramel malt and berry hop fruits with some grapefruit zest. Taste is medium sweet
  or more especially initially; some light sourness and bitterness emerges thereafter
  but the caramel malt is dominant. There may also be some salty savor. Palate is
  medium bodies, creamy sticky feel, average to lively carbonation, and a long rich
  but ultimately sweet finish. Overall, I would find it hard to say no to anyone offering
  me another.
