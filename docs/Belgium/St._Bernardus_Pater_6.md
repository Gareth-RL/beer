| **Comments** | Interesting aroma largely due to the üçå (what every dark murky beer needs). There's also some spicy dark fruit and malts for the higher primates. Pours murky brown like a soaking casserole dish with a spotty yeast puckered lace top. Taste is medium sweet with spicy notes. Palate is medium bodied at least, and sticky date sticky, carbonation is heading towards fizzy. And the finish is long and fruity. So it's taken me centuries to learn that the monks know what they are doing (frankly in other fields my experience has been the opposite). And now their bottled wisdom is stirring hipsters worldwide - you know the phrase about God's movements and mystery? Well, it applies. Second sipping in exile in Italy. Much of the above still true and I don't think the rating is wrong but my tone is different. The beer is more a solace than a mystery. |
