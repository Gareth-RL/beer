Beer: Grimbergen Cuvée Blanche
BeerID: 75071
Brewer: Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken)
City: Alken
Comments: Poured cloudy golden with full foam white top. Aroma of banana and spice.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more spice and plenty of grain. Medium bodied
  grainy texture average carbonation and a long spiced finish. So a Belgian beer with
  hints of German weissen. Refreshing but gassy.
