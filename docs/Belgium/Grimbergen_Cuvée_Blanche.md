Overall: 13.0
MyScore: 3.2
Comments: Poured cloudy golden with full foam white top. Aroma of banana and spice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more spice and plenty of grain. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a long spiced finish. So a Belgian beer with hints of German weissen. Refreshing but gassy.
