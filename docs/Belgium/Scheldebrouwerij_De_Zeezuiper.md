Comments: '"Poured orange body slightly hazy, diminishing off white lace. Some yeast
  in the scent as well as bread malt and light grapefruit. Taste is lightly sweet
  to sour. Some gummy fruit and sour berries. It wouldn''t be my go-to Tripel as I
  prefer sweetness. Medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a sticky
  sour finish. Its World Beer Award is a mystery to me. Especially as there are so
  many Belgian Tripels in circulation."'
