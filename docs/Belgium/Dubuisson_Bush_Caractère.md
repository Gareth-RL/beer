Comments: 'Poured rich brown amber with thin lacing with yeast splotches.  Aroma is
  predominantly roasted malts with some candied fruits. Taste follows the same pattern
  medium sweet to bitter with not as much heat in the finish as I feared and early
  connoisseurs noted. Palate is medium bodied oily texture offset by above average
  carbonation and a grainy finish. Apart from the  12% tag this should be a beer that
  suits me but it falters enough to make me wonder whether I want all that alcohol
  this Sunday lunchtime.  Maybe not. '
