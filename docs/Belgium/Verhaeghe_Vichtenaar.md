| **Comments** | Poured reddish chestnut body light brown tan lacing. Aroma has berries and plums and oak. The taste, as promised is sour and fruity with a lot to unpack: I got a hint of cherry and raspberry as well as plum and even fig. The oak is also there and the taste is persistently sour without, IMO, becoming acidic. Palate is medium bodied, smooth but with some tannic residue, soft carbonation and a long light sour finish. I know one shouldn't but I am struck by how much this appeals to the Scandinavian connoisseurs, and less so to the Canadians and Brits. I guess I am an Oud bruins kinda guy. |
