Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Kapittel Watou Prior
BeerID: 5388
Brewer: Leroy
City: Boezinge
Comments: Cloudy to hazy brown chestnut body with full foam cream top. Aroma is malty
  with caramel and yeasty notes. The taste is medium sweet with honeyed malt and caramel
  predominant and a musty bitter back-note. The palate is medium bodied, sticky feel,
  soft carbonation, and a light bitter finish. My bottle was labeled Prior 9 degrees
  and I suspect the beer has migrated from brewer to brewer since the trade mark bottle
  did not indicate Leroy but a different brewer van Eeke. I am trying to improve my
  appreciation of Belgian beer, especially where there are darker Abbey beers available
  but I have yet to find a favourite, and more often discover a disappointment. I
  probably should have allowed it to age a little but COVID-19 hardly induces a long
  term view!
