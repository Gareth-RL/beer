| **Comments** | bottle. A gift from my two months' old grandson (I suspect his parents were involved, despite rumours of precociousness). Pours cherry red with a pink foam. Aroma is emphatically cherry. Taste is sweet with the same note of cherry (syrupy) sustained. An alcopop. Medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a lasting fruity taste. The good news is that it is 3.5% so unlike other Belgian ales, you could drink several; the bad news is that you would not want to do so. I will see what the rest of the Haacht box contains before I start briefing the infant. |
