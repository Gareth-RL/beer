Beer: Struise Tsjeeses
BeerID: 64413
Brewer: De Struise Brouwers
City: Oostvleteren
Comments: Bottle from Brew cavern. Aroma like barley wine. Pour caramel brown white
  foam top with some sediment. Taste of candied fruit, dates and resinous. I can taste
  date and plum in here and maybe peach, all melded into a beer to drink on its own
  rather than alongside Christmas turkey with all the trimmings. An experiment for
  the drinker as well as the brewer.
