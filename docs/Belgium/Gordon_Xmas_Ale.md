Comments: Poured rich brown copper body with spotted tan creamy lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and dried fruits--date and raisins to my nose. Not quite spicy enough for mince pies. Medium sweet with a long syrup feel and then a rapid descent into something altogether murkier and slightly sour; the beer is let down by its finish. Medium bodied, smooth textured, soft to average carbonation but then that medicinal finish. Given its history, I was expecting more, and maybe it's different on draft, of course. But I do hope the Macros care for these things. And I hope some of our polished palates will revisit it some time soon. Part of my Belgian Xmas haul from B of E which looks set to survive Easter.
