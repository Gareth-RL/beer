Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Trappistes Rochefort  6
BeerID: 5401
Brewer: Abbaye Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy - Brasserie Rochefort
City: Rochefort
Comments: Poured hazy reddish amber with diminishing lacing and lasting effervescence.
  Aroma has spice, yeast and toffee malt with a hint of dark fruits. Taste is medium
  sweet with a decided malty flavour and yes, a hint of tea. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture offset (perhaps excessively) by lively carbonation and a lasting
  malty breaded finish. Much of this is pleasing apart from the gas! I can see why
  it enjoys its high rating and I am inclined to endorse the verdict of the more discerning
  top Scottish raters over that of the Scandinavians. Still playing catch-up on my
  Belgian repertoire. I like some but the yeastiness and fizziness are defects for
  me
