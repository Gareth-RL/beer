Comments: 'Bottle. Aroma caramel, cereal, toast, citrus, dough, banana, Pours dark
  amber with tan lace top. Taste is sweet with caramel malt predominating. Body is
  medium as is carbonation. What surprised me was the relatively brief finish. It’s
  not as heavy as the bottle it came in. A good rather than a great example of why
  Belgian beer is so special and different from the English version. 31/08/24. second
  sipping 7years later.  I am running down my cellar stock in Italy. My nose still
  fails to detect apricot but smells the yeast esters. Cloudy dark amber with spotted
  amber lacing (the yeast is strong in this one, Obiwon.) Caramel malts again.  Light
  bitter finish.  I judge the carbonation higher in this bottle and in this heat I
  am not surprised. 34C outside and 20C I reckon in the basement.  Not ideal for bottled
  beer. '
