Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Kwaremont Pittig Blond
BeerID: 260125
Brewer: De Brabandere
City: Harelbeke
Comments: Poured amber with white foam lasting head. Aroma has yeast, herbs, and some
  toffee malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with initial malt dominance giving
  way to a bitter hop finish; some grassy herbal notes also. Palate is medium bodied,
  slightly grainy, average to full carbonation, and a bitter finish. This is the last
  of my Belgian beer consignment and it leaves me with a mixed view; I can see the
  quality in places but suspect the yeast factor makes it unsuitable for me.
