Beer: Lupulus Brune
BeerID: 135106
Brewer: Lupulus
City: Courtil
Comments: Aroma has dark malts and spiced dark fruits fig and dates for instance.
  Poured reddish brown unclear body with off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet
  with strong malt bread character and a light bitter spice finish. Palate is medium
  bodied, slick feel average carbonation and a spicy finish. Maybe I should have gone
  for the seasonal tap beer? This Belgian was okay but nothing special.
