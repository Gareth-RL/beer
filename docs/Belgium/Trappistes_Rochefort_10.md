| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours very dark brown with diminishing off white lacing. Aroma is raisins, dark fruit, roasted dark malts with berry fruits in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet or more with some alcohol warmth. Palate is medium to full bodied creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, and a very long finish. Few people will buy this unaware of its reputation and it&#39;s grand but... When beer becomes this special has it lost some of the everyday qualities that is part of its magic?  |
