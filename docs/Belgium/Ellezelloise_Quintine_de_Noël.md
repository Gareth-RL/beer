Comments: '"Bottle from Beers of Europe. #2 of 12. Poured murky brown (sediment noted)
  brown lace top with yeast spots. Aroma of toffee malt and dark stone fruit-date
  and prune. Medium sweet with lots to catch within it: some spice, some citrus, some
  toffee malt, and plum or two that escaped. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  to soft carbonation, and a long fruit and spice finish. Actually the spice grows
  noticeably the more you sip so it''s cumulative. I doubt if I could drink many of
  these, but as a winter warmer it has its place."'
