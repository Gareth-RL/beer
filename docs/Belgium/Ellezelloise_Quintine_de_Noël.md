Overall: 15.0
MyScore: 3.6
Comments: Bottle from Beers of Europe. #2 of 12. Poured murky brown (sediment noted) brown lace top with yeast spots. Aroma of toffee malt and dark stone fruit-date and prune. Medium sweet with lots to catch within it: some spice, some citrus, some toffee malt, and plum or two that escaped. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average to soft carbonation, and a long fruit and spice finish. Actually the spice grows noticeably the more you sip so it's cumulative. I doubt if I could drink many of these, but as a winter warmer it has its place.
