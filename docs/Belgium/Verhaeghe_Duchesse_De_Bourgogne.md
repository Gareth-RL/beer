Comments: '"Tap at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours reddish cola body with thin lace rim.
  Aroma is richly fruity, russet apples and almond. Taste is lightly sweet to medium
  sour. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel fizzy carbonation and a soft sour finish.
  Too inexperienced on the Flanders front to say more than I liked it. Second sipping
  4 Sept 21 as part of Dave''s birthday gift: good stuff."'
