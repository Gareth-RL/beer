Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Oud Beersel Bersalis Tripel
BeerID: 53967
Brewer: Brouwerij Oud Beersel
City: Beersel
Comments: pours rich golden body with white foam lace. Aroma has a definite wheat/yeast
  scent with some fruit and spice notes. Taste is medium sweet to begin with a tangy
  spicy finish and little alcoholic tickle. Palate is medium bodied, smooth though
  drying to a spicy finish with soft to average carbonation. Still slightly wary of
  the yeast effect of Belgian beers on my sensitive gut, but this seems well put together
  and the Befana gave it to me so I will drink it down!
