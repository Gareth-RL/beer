| **Comments** | can from small supermarket in Bibione, Venezia-Friuli. Poured a golden body with rapidly fading foam. Malt and cabbage scent (rarely a good sign). Medium sweet to sour with background metallic note. Metallic and cardboard feel in the mouth. Medium bodied, one supposes judging by the mouth coating finish. A beer bottled or canned in Belgian but disowned by most. Don't be tempted by cheap lager is the messages |
