Comments: '"can from small supermarket in Bibione, Venezia-Friuli. Poured a golden
  body with rapidly fading foam. Malt and cabbage scent (rarely a good sign). Medium
  sweet to sour with background metallic note. Metallic and cardboard feel in the
  mouth. Medium bodied, one supposes judging by the mouth coating finish. A beer bottled
  or canned in Belgian but disowned by most. Don''t be tempted by cheap lager is the
