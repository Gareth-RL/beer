| **Comments** | Poured amber body with white lace. Aroma has hop fruit and yeast esters. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some spice notes. Texture is medium bodied, oily feel offset by lively carbonation. Bitter finish. Beers are like friends; some you get along with from the start, some grow on you, some you wonder why you ever got to know them. This one will remain an acquaintance. Too gassy for me and the yeast probably doesn't help on that score. 11/27/23 two years after sampling in Italy and only resipped because my original Belgian blonde was dodgy. Still fizzy. |
