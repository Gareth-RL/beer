Brewer: Cassels & Sons Brewing Company
City: Christchurch
Comments: Aroma is a striking part of this brew. Coffee nutty earthy notes. Poured
  black bodied with thin lace halo. Tastes less creamy and lactic than many with a
  darker bitterer coffee note. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation
  and a long smooth finish. Very good.
