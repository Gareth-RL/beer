Comments: 'Bottle. Pours clear copper with tight white lace top. Aroma is caramel,
  herbs, leaves, nuts, with certainly more malt than hops on the nose. Taste has medium
  sweetness, lightly bitter, salty, finish. Palate displays medium body, slick feel,
  average carbonation, bitter finish. Underwhelmed. 6/4/6/4/12 25/02/18 pours amber
  orange with thin white lace.  Aroma has musty yeast, caramel malts, some floral
  hop notes. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sweet. Palate is medium bodied, slick
  texture, average carbonation and a long finish. Overall, an improvement on last
  time. '
