Beer: Yeastie Boys White Noise
BeerID: 282434
Brewer: Yeastie Boys
City: Wellington
Comments: Aroma has herbal straw note. Poured a pale yellow body with thin broken
  lace top. Taste is lightly sour and bitter with a chamomile note. Palate is medium
  bodied, soft oily texture, light carbonation for a canned beer,  and a bitter finish.
  The wheat beers I have tended to enjoy have been German and livelier than this.
