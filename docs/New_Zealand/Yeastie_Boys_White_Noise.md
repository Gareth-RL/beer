| **Comments** | Aroma has herbal straw note. Poured a pale yellow body with thin broken lace top. Taste is lightly sour and bitter with a chamomile note. Palate is medium bodied, soft oily texture, light carbonation for a canned beer,  and a bitter finish. The wheat beers I have tended to enjoy have been German and livelier than this. |
