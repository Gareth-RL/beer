| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours dark brown almost black with deep tan cream top. Aroma is milky chocolate and   dark malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite chocolate note. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, average to soft carbonation, and a long finish. I expect the rating average will stabilize and improve with more UK exposure it divides American and antipodean opinions. |
