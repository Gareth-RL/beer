| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has herbs, grass, earthy, basement aromas, with some lemon on top. Appearance is hazy light yellow gold with white foam top. Taste has medium bitter lightly sweet and sour. A bit meh. Palate light to medium bodied, average carbonation, oily feel, and flat sour finish. Not their best. |
