| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma is malty caramel with chocolate notes. Pours dark brown with ruby notes and atan creamy top. Tastes of creamy toffee malt and hop fruit. A great blend with a soft finish. 5/10/19 second sipping on tap. Aroma still caramel malts. Only alteration would be palate- medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  |
