| **Comments** | Aroma has the bergamot. Pours hazy golden with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with the Earl Grey doing its spicy sweet thing all the while. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a spice finish as the tea mashes. Like having a beer with a maiden aunt. 22/07/20 second sipping confirms my initial thoughts although it reminds me that my maiden aunt was more likely to be drinking Courvoisier  brandy. |
