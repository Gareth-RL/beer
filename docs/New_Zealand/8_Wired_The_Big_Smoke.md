Beer: 8 Wired The Big Smoke
BeerID: 122164
Brewer: 8 Wired Brewing
City: Warkworth
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark reddish brown body with tan cream head. Aroma has nutty
  caramel malts light herbal hop back note. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light
  smoke flavor. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and bitter
  finish. Overall, a nicely constructed porter with enough smoke to mingle interestingly
  without overpowering other elements. But not so wonderful that I will be seeking
  it out from now on.
