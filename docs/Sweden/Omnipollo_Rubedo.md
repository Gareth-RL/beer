Comments: '"Poured the colour of Vimto [for those old enough and Anglo enough to know
  the reference) with foamy cream top. Aroma is emphatically raspberry and vanilla
  but with some other sweet wafer notes in there. Taste is predictably highly sweet
  to sour as the fruits dominate the scene, but there is a background note of white
  vanilla chocolate I believe. Palate is heavy with a sticky mouthcoating texture
  and soft carbonation, and a definitely tart sour finish that stays around. What
  is  concealed in the alcopop is the 9.5% alcohol so you would not want to leave
  this in a glass near inquisitive children. Overall, it does what it says on the
  can: it is a profoundly raspberried beer with a vanilla milkshake like texture.
  In terms of delivering its stated flavours it cannot be faulted. But the combination
  does weigh on the drinker in terms of mouthfeel and so it is a beer for sharing
  rather than drinking alone in lockdown since this hermit for one will not get through
  it!"'
