| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. At a price that easily makes this the most expensive tap ale I have ever encountered but it may be worth it. Pours black body and halo of tan lacing. Aroma is sensational in every sense. If you like your dark beer to be within the cake/gateau spectrum then this is for you. Beside the cinnamon is coffee, chocolate especially chocolate liqueur for the English nose, cherry, vanilla and the kind of alcoholic heat that I can detect in Bourbon. Taste is sweet but in intricacy and with the kind of emphasis that only Americans can lend the word. Palate is full &#40;can&#39;t you tell?&#41;  texture is creamy, carbonation &#40;thankfully&#41; is no more than soft as this needs little encouragement. Finish is as languorous as you wish but may still be too soon. I can&#39;t imagine an evening of beer of this calibre except by the thimbleful but the world is the better for it. |
