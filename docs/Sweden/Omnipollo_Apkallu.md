| **Comments** | Citrus aroma grapefruit tangerine pineapple. Poured hazy golden body with thin lace top. Taste is juicy and medium sweet with a bitter slightly chalky finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. A solid pale ale with the hoppiness one expects. |
