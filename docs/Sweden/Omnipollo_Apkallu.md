Comments: Citrus aroma grapefruit tangerine pineapple. Poured hazy golden body with
  thin lace top. Taste is juicy and medium sweet with a bitter slightly chalky finish.
  Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  A solid pale ale with the hoppiness one expects.
