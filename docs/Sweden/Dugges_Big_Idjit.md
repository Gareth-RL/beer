| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours expresso black with tan halo. Aroma roasted malts some chocolate coffee vanilla notes but not quite as overpowering as feared. Taste is medium bitter to sweet with definite chocolate notes. Palate is fantastic. My best yet full bodied creamy and rich, flat carbonation and a not so much languor that you hesitate to sip again. Alright it&#39;s a finale beer but deservedly so |
