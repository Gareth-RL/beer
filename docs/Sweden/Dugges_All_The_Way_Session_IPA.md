| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma is a modest affair, pale malts and a whiff of peach but more understated than the young Hugh Grant. Pour pale yellow gold with circle of white lace, mostly lasting. Taste has light mediocrity of bitterness that sours a little. Palate is medium body, sticky feel, soft carbonation, abrupt finish . I hazard the view that this is a  recurring experience with Scandinavian pale ale  - variable quality. |
