Beer: Dugges All The Way Session IPA
BeerID: 288508
Brewer: Dugges Bryggeri
City: Landvetter
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma is a modest affair, pale malts and a whiff of
  peach but more understated than the young Hugh Grant. Pour pale yellow gold with
  circle of white lace, mostly lasting. Taste has light mediocrity of bitterness that
  sours a little. Palate is medium body, sticky feel, soft carbonation, abrupt finish
  . I hazard the view that this is a  recurring experience with Scandinavian pale
  ale  - variable quality.
