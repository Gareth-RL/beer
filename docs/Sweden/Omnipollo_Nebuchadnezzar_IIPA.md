| **Comments** | Aroma berry hop and roasted malts with enough toffee to flag its potency  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with the hops in this imperial lagging a little. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish where the hops flourish. Interesting. Obviously it suits its home market - Scandinavian and German- more than Anglo American.  |
