Comments: 'Aroma berry hop and roasted malts with enough toffee to flag its potency  Taste
  is medium sweet to lightly bitter with the hops in this imperial lagging a little.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish
  where the hops flourish. Interesting. Obviously it suits its home market - Scandinavian
  and German- more than Anglo American. '
