| **Comments** | Keg. I confess I read the reviews which told me that the color, aroma and taste of this changes but generally even those who regard it as beer masquerading as fruit juice liked it. Much of this is down to the mango scent and associated tropical fruits that overwhelmed the nose. Unless my eyes deceived me it was cloudy orange with no top or lace to speak of. This disappointed. I believe a man should trust his head. But I don’t deny I liked the taste. Strong sweet sour qualities with the sourness growing as the sweetness fell. It does curl the tongue and clam the palate so not recommended as a starter. But as wild ales go, it rocks. (an expression that immediately places me and my ilk in a different century). Tap at the Keans head. Pours cloudy orange with a little more lacing to the halo. Aroma remains mango upon mango with apricot and lychee creeping into the mix. Taste as above and disguising my disappointment that this is not new to me, it's still refreshing and good. Third sample and still like the fruits. |
