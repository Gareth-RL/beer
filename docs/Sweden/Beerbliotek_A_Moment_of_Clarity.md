Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange with white lacing. Aroma has spruce,
  herbs, resin, bread, reflecting the hoppy dominance. Taste is medium bitter with
  a light souring. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to soft carbonation,
  some languor but only modestly astringent. Like other Beerbibliotek beers I am left
  underwhelmed. They don''t make me want to leap on a boat to Sweden. 23 Jan 19 ditto."'
