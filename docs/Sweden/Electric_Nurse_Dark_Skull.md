Brewer: Electric Nurse
City: Göteborg
Comments: Tap. Aroma of roasted caramel malts. Pours black with tan lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter as fruity alcohol melds to bitter dark chocolate. Palate
  is medium to full, oily texture, soft carbonation, and long finish. An imperial
  primed for sweet Christmas flavours that might also sugar kick the abv to even dizzier
  heights. A one is enough beer.
