| **Comments** | Can at JDW Company Inn. Pours clear orange with fleeting thin scummy top. Aroma is vaguely spicy citrus but you need to go looking for it. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, lively carbonation, slick texture, and crisp finish. If this were a car, it would revv like a milk float. A great example of how labelling can conceal the blandness of reality. But hey, it&#39;s a lager. |
