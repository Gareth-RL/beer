| **Comments** | Keg at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan lacing. Aroma is richly chocolate and vanilla with enough lactose to evoke ice cream. Taste is richly sweet and lightly bitter and to my taste completely. Palate is full bodied but smooth textured, average to soft carbonation, and chocolate languorous finish. Overall a finely crafted imperial porter. |
