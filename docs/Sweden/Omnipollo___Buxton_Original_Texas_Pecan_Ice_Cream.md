BeerID: 464272
Brewer: Omnipollo
City: Sundbyberg
Comments: Keg at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan lacing. Aroma is richly
  chocolate and vanilla with enough lactose to evoke ice cream. Taste is richly sweet
  and lightly bitter and to my taste completely. Palate is full bodied but smooth
  textured, average to soft carbonation, and chocolate languorous finish. Overall
  a finely crafted imperial porter.
