| **Comments** | Poured murky golden amber with thin lace top. Aroma has some lemon citrus and roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet with grapefruit and melon and a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A soft pale but nothing remarkable. |
