| **Comments** | Tap at the Kean&#39;s Head. Pours hazy yellow with white lace circle. Aroma is mango with a hint of lime. Taste is medium sweet to sour but with a salty kick. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture with some lactose stickiness, average carbonation, and a salty finish. Interesting and refreshing although I can&#39;t imagine drinking pints. |
