| **Comments** | Tap at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream lace top. Aroma is chocolate coffee toffee Grenache greatness. Taste is medium sweet with a light bitterness. Palate is medium to full bodied with creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a languorous finish that has some bitterness at the back to offset the sweetness. |
