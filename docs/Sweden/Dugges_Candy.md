| **Comments** | These are the kind of beers where the nose leads. Vanilla whiskey burn and chocolate buzz you.   pours black with tan lace.  Taste is medium to full sweet with caramelized malts all the way down running interference with the sheer booziness. Palate is medium to full bodied, rich creamy silky, formidable . Efforts are well spent controlling the alcohol heat. Money well spent. |
