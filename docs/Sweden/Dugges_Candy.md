Brewer: Dugges Bryggeri
City: Landvetter
Comments: These are the kind of beers where the nose leads. Vanilla whiskey burn and
  chocolate buzz you.   pours black with tan lace.  Taste is medium to full sweet
  with caramelized malts all the way down running interference with the sheer booziness.
  Palate is medium to full bodied, rich creamy silky, formidable . Efforts are well
  spent controlling the alcohol heat. Money well spent.
