| **Comments** | Keg at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours dark golden amber unclear with thin white lace top. Aroma has ripe pineapple and mango hops and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a long smooth finish. In fact the palate is probably its major feature since it transitions from the hops without allowing the alcohol to burn nor resorting to caramel malts. These guys know their brewing. |
