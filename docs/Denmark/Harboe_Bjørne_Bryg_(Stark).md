Comments: Poured golden body, with thin diminishing lace. Aroma of bread malt and herbal hop. Medium sweet to bitter with light fruit notes. Medium body, oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. An odd nondescript lager: not a great ad for either Danish or Italian brewing. None of the usual Pilsener characteristics
