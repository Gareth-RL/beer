| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee malts and seasonal spices cinnamon and nutmeg. Pours dark brown body and thin lace top diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with spice nicely present without overwhelming everything. Palate is medium bodied silly texture with spice tears, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Santa's secret is in safe hands. |
