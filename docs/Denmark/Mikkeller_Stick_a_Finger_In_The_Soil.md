| **Comments** | Aroma has toffee malts and tropical hops.Appearance is golden body with white foam top. The taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a soft lasting sweet finish. I could imagine sipping it in a Copenhagen garden and it melds its ingredients well. |
