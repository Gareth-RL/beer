| **Comments** | Can. Poured orange golden body with scummy lace top. Aroma has toffee malts and citric and piney hops. Taste is medium to full bitter with a drying finish. I guess it was the dry mouth bitterness that put me off it. It's a double hopped lager rather than a pale ale. And it's mixture doesn't end there. It's by a Danish brewer mimicking an American style of European origin and made in Belgium. Bought in Sainsbury's Nottingham and it won't be again. |
