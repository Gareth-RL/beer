| **Comments** | Tap. I think the abv 2.7% and effort to keep the cucumber scent and flavours boosted the score for me. Aroma has cucumber pickle and lemon. Pours cloudy ultra pale yellow with green tint. White lace top . Taste is tart. Cucumber sandwich with milk on the side. An experiment that edges towards Gose. And one that is worth tasting Once. |
