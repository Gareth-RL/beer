| **Comments** | Can. Pours orange gold, Lively off white foam head &#40;if you pour it badly in a tulip glass. Aroma apricot grassy resinous and yeasty. Taste is medium sweet to full bitter taste. Palate is medium bodied, lively to average carbonation, sticky, feel, long bitter finish. Slightly befuddled by the Belgian brewery attribution for a Danish beer. But a pleasant pale. |
