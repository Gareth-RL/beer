Comments: '"Can. Somewhat surprised to see this in Sainsbury''s. Pours golden honey
  body with thin lace top. Grassy hop scent with a hint of citrus. Taste is lightly
  sweet to drying medium bitterness with a hint of chalk in the finish. Palate is
  medium bodied, drying in the mouth, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Certainly
  a beer that could help a summer day achieve its purpose."'
