Comments: '"It''s good to know that it''s not just in Eurovision that the Scandinavian
  and Germans vote for their own. That said, I vote for it too. All the classic dark
  malt aromas float here. Perfectly formed black body with creamy tan top. This is
  what an imperial stout should look like.  But taste is intriguing. Most IS that
  I sample go sweet to contain the burn. This has some bitterness like a dry stout
  rather than a milk stout. So on the balance side this is bitter rather than sweet
  stout. Palate is medium bodied, lighter than some in feel but with enough cling
  to avoid the chasm that is watery (I never rate a watery stout kindly). So how do
  I score the Dane? To 4 or not to 4? Hell I am English so Eurovision rules do not
  apply."'
