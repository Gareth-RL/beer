Comments: 'Tap at the Brew Dog. Pours opaque black with halo of tan lace. Aroma has
  chocolate coffee dark fruit and seaweed. Taste is medium sweet with a salty tang
  and creamy richness. Palate is medium to full, creamy texture, soft carbonation,
  and a long rich finish. The alcoholic burn is more in the fore than finish. Not
  sure what the champagne yeast added but I assume the caviar accounts for the saltiness
  and frankly I prefer my caviar this way. Prodigious is my summation even if it plays
  across a  relatively narrow range of flavours overall. '
