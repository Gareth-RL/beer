| **Comments** | Tap at the Kean&#39;s Head. Pours amber with some lacing albeit diminishing. Aroma more toffee malt than coffee. But on tasting I guess it depends on how you take your coffee. Some notes which played against the hoppy spectrum is subtle and intriguing. Taste is medium medium sweet and bitter almost simultaneously. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a murky finish edging towards bitter rather than sour. Obviously huge in Scandinavia but it has not made me someone on the prowl for coffee IPA. |
