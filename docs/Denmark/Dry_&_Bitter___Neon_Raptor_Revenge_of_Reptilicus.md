| **Comments** | Aroma has pine and mango. Pours cloudy murky orange golden body and scummy white lace. Taste is chock full of fruits so medium sweet but then souring to a bitter finish.  Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a smooth full fruited DIPA. Bring back the dinosaurs if this is what they are drinking. |
