| **Comments** | Tap. Coffee notes. Pours expresso black with thin tan top and anymore lacing is broken and diminishing. Taste is medium , to heavy sweetness, lightly sour, salty finish. Palate medium body, creamy, average carbonation, long finish. All good and yet there is something missing in terms of overall complexity, and maybe the biochemists surrounding me can explain what. |
