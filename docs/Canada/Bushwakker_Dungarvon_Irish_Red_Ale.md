| **Comments** | I hope this isn’t typical of Canadian craft. Aroma wise little to report although appearance is copper red with lace top. Taste is the key. It’s bland rather than smoooth. The malt doesn’t carry enough complexity and it lies on the palate like Wayne Rooney’s hair. My appreciation may be coloured by a noisy Wetherspoons &#40;hen party to the left&#41; and the sight of England v. San Marino 0-0 after 7 minutes.  |
