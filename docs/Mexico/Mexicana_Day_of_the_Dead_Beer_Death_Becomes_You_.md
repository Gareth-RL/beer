Comments: '"Bottle. A bargain at £2.70. Pours copper with broken off white lacing.
  Aroma is caramelized malts with toffee bread notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.
  Palate medium bodied average carbonation oily feel and bitter finish. It&#39;s most
  remarkable feature is we live in a world where I can buy a Mexican beer in JDW more
  reliably than a Surrey one."'
