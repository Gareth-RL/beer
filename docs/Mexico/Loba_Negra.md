| **Comments** | Bottle from Beers of Europe (the obvious source for a Mexican beer). Poured dark brown almost black body with thin broken tan lacing. Aroma has dark roasted malts with a little coffee and chocolate noted. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more chocolate and a light initial taste of caramel. Palate is thin to medium and possibly its weakest quality as a porter. A little mouth coating, average carbonation and a surprisingly bitter finish given the malts' previous character. Nonetheless, it leaves me intrigued by Loba Artesenal and by the Mexican craft scene in general. When I visit it will feature. |
