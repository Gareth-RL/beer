| **Comments** | Bought in the one and only Mexican restaurant I visited on this US trip and it was either this or Miller draft. Some roasted malts in the scent. Poured copper amber body with no lacing to speak of. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light caramel notes. It's the palate that damns it. Medium to thin bodied, highly carbonated, which works against a beer that privileges malt and there is something unpleasant in the finish. Fortunately the enchiladas and tacos were excellent. |
