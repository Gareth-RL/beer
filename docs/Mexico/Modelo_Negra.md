Comments: '"Bought in the one and only Mexican restaurant I visited on this US trip
  and it was either this or Miller draft. Some roasted malts in the scent. Poured
  copper amber body with no lacing to speak of. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with
  light caramel notes. It''s the palate that damns it. Medium to thin bodied, highly
  carbonated, which works against a beer that privileges malt and there is something
  unpleasant in the finish. Fortunately the enchiladas and tacos were excellent."'
