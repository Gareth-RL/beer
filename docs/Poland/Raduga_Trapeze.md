| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham since it seems to be Polish week. Aroma is emphatically fruity possibly passionfruit but it has been a while since I encountered said fruit. Could also be mango with yeast. Pours a decidedly murky orange gold with white lace circle. Taste is medium sweet sour with barely a whisker between them. Palate is the light side of medium bodied, carbonation the lively side of average, texture edges towards the slick after an oily start, and the finish is not so much languorous as hesitant. Overall I enjoyed its indecision. It spoke to me. Somehow a passionfruit wheat beer is a better emblem of Poland than any Pope will ever be. |
