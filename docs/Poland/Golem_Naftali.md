| **Comments** | Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Pours yellow gold slightly hazy, thin lace. Aroma has citrus more lemon and melon but hints of grapefruit pith. Lactose also so a muddied quality. Taste lightly sweet, sour, bitter sequence but the murkiness remains. Palate is light to medium but with a definite viscous feel &#40;sticky don&#39;t cover it&#41;. Carbonation average I guess. Finish is unfinished. And yet, it&#39;s nice. |
