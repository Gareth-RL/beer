Comments: '"Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Pours yellow gold slightly hazy, thin lace.
  Aroma has citrus more lemon and melon but hints of grapefruit pith. Lactose also
  so a muddied quality. Taste lightly sweet, sour, bitter sequence but the murkiness
  remains. Palate is light to medium but with a definite viscous feel &#40;sticky
  don&#39;t cover it&#41;. Carbonation average I guess. Finish is unfinished. And
  yet, it&#39;s nice."'
