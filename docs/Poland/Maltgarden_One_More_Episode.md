Comments: '"Bottle. Poured black cola body with tan head. Some strawberry scent albeit
  heavily dipped in cocoa. Taste is heavy sweet chocolate with a definite malty tang
  thank goodness. Fortunately not as strawberried as I feared. Texture is medium to
  full bodied, mouthcoating and soft carbonation, I believe silky is the term, although
  there is a small finishing eruption of other bitter qualities that is worth waiting
  for. Clearly a hit in its native Poland and with the cognoscente of Edinburgh, and
  although it lacks some complexity and range, it is what precisely what it says and
  imperial stout heavily imbued with cocoa nibs and with some strawberry notes. Suitable
  festive; imagine it''s a liquor chocolate."'
