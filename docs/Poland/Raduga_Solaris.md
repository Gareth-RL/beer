Beer: Raduga Solaris
BeerID: 598373
Brewer: Raduga
City: Warszawa
Comments: Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Pours like cold black coffee. Aroma has dark
  stone fruits and caramel chocolate malts plus alcohol. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly sour, with chocolate bitterness lurking below. Palate is full body, thick
  feel, soft carbonation, long finish. Probably one of the lowest scores that I have
  given an imperial stout; usually the complexity demands higher but this is good
  yet pedestrian.
