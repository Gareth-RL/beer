Comments: '"I am not as hostile as the Scandinavian connoisseurs since for me fine
  lager remains something of a paradox. This one pours golden edging amber with fine
  off white lace. It smells of pale malts and nutty bread. The taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with not a lot of hop discernible. But the palate detracts, it''s fizzy
  and dusty. If you are going to imbibe 7% abv make it worth your while"'
