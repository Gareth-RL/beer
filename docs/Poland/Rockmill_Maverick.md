| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours orange with a thin lace circle. Aroma is floral citrus hops. Taste is medium sweet and eventually lightly bitter with a  fleeting sour transition. Palate is barely medium bodied, texture is oily, carbonation average to soft, finish is &#40;how should I put it&#41; understated but bitter. A brewery named Rockmill and a beer named Maverick in Poland. Why should it not taste like thousands of others across the planet?  And do so to the satisfaction of drinkers around the Baltic. |
