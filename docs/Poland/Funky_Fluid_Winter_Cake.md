| **Comments** | Depends on your love of chocolate orange. A Xmas perennial in the UK. Poured black with tan lace top. Aroma has orange extract atop chocolate malts with spicy notes. Taste is hyper sweet with a chocolate backnote but not much in the way of complexity or transition. Palate is thin but sticky with a grainy finish. An abiding sense of artificiality. |
