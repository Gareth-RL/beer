| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured dark brown almost black body, tan lacing diminishing. Aroma is malty: roasted, light chocolate, hints of licorice, dark fruits. Taste is medium sweet with a licorice tang and a chocolate finish; nice. Palate is medium bodied, smooth, average carbonation, and a long finish. My first beer after a bout of COVID so I am relieved the tastebuds are still functioning. I also suspect it is my first Pomeranian, and it confirms my liking for Baltic Porter. |
