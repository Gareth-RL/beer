Comments: Poured golden body white lace top.  Aroma of pale malt and herbal hop.  Medium sweet to bitter with a certain syrupy blandness.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  A reminder of why I am unimpressed by lager. From the local Mestre supermarket in Italy
