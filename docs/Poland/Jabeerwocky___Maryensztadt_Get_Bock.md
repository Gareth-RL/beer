| **Comments** | Aroma has stewed plums and dark sugary malts - very nice. Pours dark amber with off white lacing. Taste is medium sweet with a definite syrupy tang. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a pretty relentless sweetness. I like this kind of beer; a tendency I ascribe to my misspent Lancastrian youth. This is an odd origin for my liking for Polish produced German style beer, but (trust me) not my oddest proclivity derived from this singular beginning. |
