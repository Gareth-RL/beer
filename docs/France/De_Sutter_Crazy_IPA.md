| **Comments** | Aroma is lightly grapefruit, grassy and herbal hop. Poured  clear golden body, white lace top. Taste is lightly sweet with a drying grainy bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Pretty standard fare but I rarely drink French craft so this was an experiment.   |
