Comments: 'Aroma is lightly grapefruit, grassy and herbal hop. Poured  clear golden
  body, white lace top. Taste is lightly sweet with a drying grainy bitterness. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Pretty
  standard fare but I rarely drink French craft so this was an experiment.  '
