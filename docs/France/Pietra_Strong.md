| **Comments** | Bottle unexpectedly picked up in E-ataly, the food mart for Italian food and drink in Trieste. Poured hazy amber chestnut. Off white lacing.  Aroma is bready malts and chestnuts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter; again, there's more a light maltloaf taste rather than a sweet chestnut one and the hops are buried. Palate is medium bodied grainy average carbonation and a bitter finish. An oddity, which may be out of production for now but if Corsica is now Italian, Napoleon needs to be told. |
