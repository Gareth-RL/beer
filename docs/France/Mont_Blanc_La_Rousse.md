Comments: '"Bottle. Poured murky reddish amber with thin beige lace top. Aroma has
  spicy hop and bready malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a strong
  jammy fruit note. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and
  a sour rather than bitter finish although the sweetness never entirely goes away.
  Frankly, I am never sure what to expect with an international amber ale, and like
  the English amber, beyond the colour it does seem to err towards the bland. But
  I like sweet malts and fruity hops and it''s 28 degrees here today so it fills a
  need!"'
