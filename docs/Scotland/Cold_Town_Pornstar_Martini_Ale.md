Comments: 'Last few Lidl brews. Poured a golden body with foamy white top. Aroma has
  strong passion fruit which one suspects may not have been found in nature. Taste
  is medium to full sweet with hints of vanilla and sherbet and the said fruit will
  not go quietly into the bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture,
  average to full carbonation and a bitter finish. Being a simple provincial lad,
  I have never had a pornstar martini so I cannot comment on its parallels. But emphatically
  a fruit flavoured beer. '
