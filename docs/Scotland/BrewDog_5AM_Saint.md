Comments: '"Tap. Pours dark amber with fine white lace top. Aroma is predominantly
  hoppy - citrus and pine. Taste has some malt. Taste is mixed. light sweetness, lightly
  bitter, lightly sour, umami, but in a cluttered way for me. There&#39;s no defining
  quality to this. In passing I note that experienced reviewers tended to drink this
  in 2009/10, and those that return are less impressed."'
