Brewer: Belhaven (Greene King)
City: Dunbar
Comments: Cask. Aroma of roasted malt. Golden colour with lace top. Tastes of wholemeal
  bread and bread. Light and easy drinking with a refreshing bitter sparkle in the
  finish. My ideal session bitter if the aim was mainly to keep company but it’s unlikely
  to win a CAMRA award these days given the abundance of great IPAs around.
