Beer: BrewDog vs. Cloudwater - New England IPA V2
BeerID: 529484
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Keg. Aroma is robust grapefruit pith, lemon and pineapples. Pours a hazy
  even cloudy amber gold with thin white lace top. Given the pungency the taste is
  a little surprising in its muted qualities. I was expecting a sharp sweet beginning
  and a sour ending but there is something subtler here which may be a product of
  the Brewdog chill or something more. Anyway it seems to pivot on the bitter switch
  point. That place where the taste buds switch is so confused in my case that there
  is almost a gap. And as any visitor to London or Tube employee will tell you &quot;mind
  the gap.&quot; That said, the end is sour and good.
