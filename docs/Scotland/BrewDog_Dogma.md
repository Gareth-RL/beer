| **Comments** | Tap at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black body tan foam top. Aroma richly roasted malts dark fruits, coffee and chocolate cake. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium to full bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long finish. A Scotch ale worthy of the title. 24 May 2020 a different beast from the can. pours copper bodied with white lace. I must have confused my dogmas. Aroma is a blend of grainy malts with bread and light caramel in the mix; too intricate and nuanced for my hay fevered nose. Taste is not as sweet as a honeyed beer might imply, but medium bitter up front, honey centred and then bitter finished. Palate is medium, smooth soft carbonation and a bitter finish. As the Scots say: this'll do me. |
