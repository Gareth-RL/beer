| **Comments** | Bottle from Beer52. Pours hazy orange brown with thin off white lace. Aroma has citrus orange/tangerine and floral notes and a little pale grape. Taste is light sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour, with a pithy bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily palate, average carbonation, astringent finish. Overall, it&#39;s not a type I will seek out. |
