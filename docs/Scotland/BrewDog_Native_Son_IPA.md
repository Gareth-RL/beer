| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours golden amber with white lacing. Aroma mandarin hops so like neat orange concentrate. Taste is medium sweet with a lighter bitter note and sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily sticky feel, fizzy carbonation, souring astringent finish. Overall not a great DIPA. |
