| **Comments** | Tap @brewdog Nottingham. Pours dark amber brown with definite ruby lights &#40;hold it to the light&#41;. Off white lace top. Aroma is cereal, bread, toast, herbs, dough, raisin, woody, an excellent combination of roasted malts and hoppy fruits. The grapefruit and mandarin are registered later. Taste is medium sweet to bitter and maybe even a sour tang. It fizzes. Palate has no more than medium body, oily feel, average carbonation, long finish, that ultimately might be sour. A beer that rewards reflection. |
