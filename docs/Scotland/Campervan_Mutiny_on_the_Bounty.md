Comments: '"Tap. The nose tells you that you are in complex company. Coffee and chocolate
  one expects but coconut is a nice addition. And slowly the pun in the name dawns.
  Pours black with thin tan top. Medium rather than full bodied and there may be milk
  stout fans who want a fuller texture on the palate but I liked it. Well done campervan
