| **Comments**  | Poured irn bru orange body. Aroma candy sugar. Taste has the promised ginger kick that cuts against the sweet soda. Thin to medium bodied grainy but that is overpowered by the ginger fizz. Sticky sweet finish. A gimmick                                                                                       |
