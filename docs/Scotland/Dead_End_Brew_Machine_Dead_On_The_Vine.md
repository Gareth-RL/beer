Comments: '"@The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours hazy orange gold with thin lace halo.
  Aroma has lime zest and spicy hops. Taste is medium sweet with peach there and a
  hint of pineapple. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation
  and a soft sweet languor. Good in parts but none relates strongly to Withier "'
