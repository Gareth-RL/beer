| **Comments** | @The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours hazy orange gold with thin lace halo. Aroma has lime zest and spicy hops. Taste is medium sweet with peach there and a hint of pineapple. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a soft sweet languor. Good in parts but none relates strongly to Withier  |
