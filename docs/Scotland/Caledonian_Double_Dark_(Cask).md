BeerID: 112684
Brewer: Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK)
City: Edinburgh
Comments: Cask at the Boat. Aroma roasted oats with chocolate notes. Pours dark brown
  with tan lacing. Taste of sweet milk chocolate with mild biscuit malt underpinning
  and some lingering hoppy piquancy on the palate. My only complaint would be the
  thinness of the body. Too light as a dark but that may be the risk with old recipes.
