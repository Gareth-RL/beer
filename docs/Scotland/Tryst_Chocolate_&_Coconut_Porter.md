Comments: '"@Nottingham beer festival. Appearance chestnut dark brown thin top. Aroma
  has chocolate with light coconut notes but overall it&#39;s a malty porter with
  sweetness. Taste medium sweet. Palate light to medium body. Carbonation soft. Finish
  is bitter after a sweet beginning. Good."'
