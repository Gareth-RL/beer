| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy golden amber with white lace halo. Aroma has funk, which seems to have also featured in the cigarettes of my misspent youth. Taste is medium bitter with some fruit lurking here and especially there. Palate is medium bodied,oily feel, average carbonation and a crisp finish. I bought it for the low abv and respect how much it delivers from it. Also wondering how passionfruit got into my cigarettes.... |
