| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma is more emphatically chocolate than peanut butter but I am okay with that. Pours black with tan lace circle. A little lacing. Taste is predictably sweet medium to strong with a salty tang and just the chocolate edge of bitterness.medium body, creamy, soft carbonation, and thus a melt rather than a finish. Riot&#033; I went wild &#40;quietly&#41;. |
