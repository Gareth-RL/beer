Comments: '"Aroma has red berries, chocolate, muscavado sugar, and all the mellow
  malty goodness. Pours black with a halo. Taste is medium to full sweet but never
  oversweet. Palate is medium to full bodied, smooth CV silky feel, soft to average
  carbonation, and a luxuriant finish. It''s a shame that this is 15percent, and that
  it no longer tastes like any beer my ancestors knew. But still delicious."'
