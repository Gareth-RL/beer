| **Comments** | Cask at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours dark body and tan cream top. Aroma has a delightful  mix of dark malts some coffee and toffee. Taste accordingly is medium sweet with just the bitter tang in the finish. Palate is medium or higher , texture smooth and creamy, carbonation average, and yep bitter finish. It brought out my inner Scotsman. |
