| **Comments**  | Poured chestnut body off-white lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts and chocolate.  Medium sweet to bitter, mainly more malt with light chocolate roast notes.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Judging by the reviews, a well travelled Mild but new to me.                                                                                      |
