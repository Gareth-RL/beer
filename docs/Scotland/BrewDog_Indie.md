| **Comments** | Reputation is a perilous thing. Brewdog Nottingham. BD has gone beyond session pale by the success of Punk, so this is likely to suffer. And it&#39;s nondescript. Aroma is a muted medley of citrus floral herbal hop with nothing standing out. Pours golden with a swirl. Taste is medium bitter with a  definite blandness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, bitter crisp finish. Lots of breweries turn this sort out in cask and call it blonde and it sinks as well. But for Brewdog it&#39;s a howler. |
