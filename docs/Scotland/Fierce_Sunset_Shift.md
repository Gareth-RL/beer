Beer: Fierce Sunset Shift
BeerID: 658499
Brewer: Fierce Beer Co
City: Dyce, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma has toffee malts and berry hops. Pours clear
  amber with off white foam lacing. The taste is medium bitter with light sourness.
  The palate is medium bodied , oily texture, average to fizzy carbonation, and a
  sour finish. This began well and then fell away so it is not as good as many fine
  ales from Fierce one of my favorite Scottish brewers.
