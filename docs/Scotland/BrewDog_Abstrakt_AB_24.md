| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours black with halo of tan lace. Aroma is alcohol, chocolate caramel roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with a delicious balance between the two the equivalent of a pirouette in beer terms. Palate medium to full bodied, somewhere between slick and oily which I guess is smooth. Carbonation is the average side of soft. Finish is long and alcoholic but without the alcohol burn. Impressive. |
