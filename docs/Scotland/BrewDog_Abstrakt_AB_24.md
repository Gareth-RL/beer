Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog. Pours black with halo of tan lace. Aroma is alcohol, chocolate
  caramel roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with a delicious balance
  between the two the equivalent of a pirouette in beer terms. Palate medium to full
  bodied, somewhere between slick and oily which I guess is smooth. Carbonation is
  the average side of soft. Finish is long and alcoholic but without the alcohol burn.
  Impressive.
