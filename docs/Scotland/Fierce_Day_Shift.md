Brewer: Fierce Beer Co
City: Dyce, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Keg. Aroma full of citrus and pine as promised. Pours hazy orange gold with
  broken white lace. Taste medium sweet and sour with a bitter finish on the palate.
  Fuller bodied than some session pales and personally I prefer a crisp finish. Still
  excellent.
