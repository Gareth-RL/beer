| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body with tan lace top. Chocolate/cocoa predominant in the scent. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with vanilla evident. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel, soft to average carbonation and a long complex finish with vanilla coffee and cocoa notes reactivated. Interesting |
