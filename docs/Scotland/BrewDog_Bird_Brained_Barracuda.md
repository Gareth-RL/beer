| **Comments** | Dark malty nose: boozy, coffee licorice. Pours black bodied with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with the alcohol heat evident throughout. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a boozy finish.  Too boozy for the palate but I guess it might otherwise be sweeter. 03/05/20 Second sipping from the can. The taste was better in the sense of less heat and hence the palate improved. Maybe the barrel aged ales welcome further confinement; unlike humans. |
