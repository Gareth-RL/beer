Comments: '"Father''s Day gift. Pungent vanilla scent with a hint of doughnut. Pours
  cloudy, murky reddish brown with yeasty broken lacing. Taste is initially very sweet
  as the sugar, vanilla and berries combine, but then it sours. The texture is medium
  bodied, slightly sticky, although not in a jammy way,  soft to average carbonation
  and light bitter finish, although the sweetness never fully dies. The score reflects
  my attempt to mark the style and ingredients. My old fogey status makes the Sour
  fad alien for me, but you can''t fault the ability to deliver what is on the tin."'
