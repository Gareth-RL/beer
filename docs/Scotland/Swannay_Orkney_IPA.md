BeerID: 88595
Brewer: Swannay Brewery
City: Swannay by Evie, Orkney
Comments: Cask. Aroma mildly grapefruit and floral hops. Pours pale amber. Thin top
  broken fading lacing. Tastes pleasantly of Maris Otter and so many brewers talk
  of ingredients and then bury them. This one does what it promises and delivers a
  session IPA.
