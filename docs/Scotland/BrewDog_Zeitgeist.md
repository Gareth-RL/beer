Comments: '"Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours dark edging black with tan lacing. Aroma
  is roasty, nuts, spruce, although to my novice mind it loses in this instance by
  being highly chilled. Maybe it&#39;s a lager thing. Taste is medium bitter with
  not a lot of drift. Palate is medium bodied, texture is surprisingly light, carbonation
  lively, finish bitter, although it is equally a sustained note. Utterly unqualified
  on this beer type, but it will never be a favorite."'
