| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours dark edging black with tan lacing. Aroma is roasty, nuts, spruce, although to my novice mind it loses in this instance by being highly chilled. Maybe it&#39;s a lager thing. Taste is medium bitter with not a lot of drift. Palate is medium bodied, texture is surprisingly light, carbonation lively, finish bitter, although it is equally a sustained note. Utterly unqualified on this beer type, but it will never be a favorite. |
