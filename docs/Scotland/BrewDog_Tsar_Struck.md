| **Comments** | Dark malt nose you know the type - coffee chocolate and caramel malt with a berry fruit note lurking. Pours black with deep tan lace albeit diminishing. Taste is a notch above medium sweet as if someone snatched your dark chocolate and replaced it with a milk one so are you the vindictive type? Palate is medium bodied albeit with some creaminess of feel carbonation soft to average, finish sweet and the alcohol heat is completely buried. On to the Winter Palace! Second sipping. Yum! |
