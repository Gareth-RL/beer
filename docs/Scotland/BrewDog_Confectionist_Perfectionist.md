| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate malt and vanilla marshmallow. Poured black bodied with tan lace. Taste is fully sweet with a fruity tang. Not for the non sweet toothed. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long light bitter finish. Decent dessert stout 16/07/20 second sipping as I pace myself through the pandemic. I got it right the first time but they handle the carbonation in the can well. |
