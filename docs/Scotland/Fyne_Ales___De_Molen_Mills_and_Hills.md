Brewer: Fyne Ales
City: Cairndow
Comments: Poured Black. Thin lace top. Luscious fruitcake scent. Treacle.  Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter with chocolate coffee caramel and boozy notes.  Palate medium
  bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. This is my
  kind of beer but you have to drink it by the eggcup rather than the stein.
