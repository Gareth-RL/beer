| **Comments** | Poured Black. Thin lace top. Luscious fruitcake scent. Treacle.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with chocolate coffee caramel and boozy notes.  Palate medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. This is my kind of beer but you have to drink it by the eggcup rather than the stein. |
