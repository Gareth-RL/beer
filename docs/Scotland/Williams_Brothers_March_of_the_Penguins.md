Beer: Williams Brothers March of the Penguins
BeerID: 139938
Brewer: Williams Brothers Brewing (Heather Ales)
City: Alloa, Clackmannanshire
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark brown to black with thin tan head. Aroma has roasted
  malts and slight chocolate notes but more emphatically bread malts. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation although
  the bottle has an initial fizz that suggests at least average. The finish is bitter
  and languid. Overall, a pleasant stout but the coriander and orange zest got lost
  somewhere in Antarctica.
