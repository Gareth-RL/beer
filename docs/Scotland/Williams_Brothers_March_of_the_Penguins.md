| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours dark brown to black with thin tan head. Aroma has roasted malts and slight chocolate notes but more emphatically bread malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation although the bottle has an initial fizz that suggests at least average. The finish is bitter and languid. Overall, a pleasant stout but the coriander and orange zest got lost somewhere in Antarctica. |
