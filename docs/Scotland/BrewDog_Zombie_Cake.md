Comments: 'Coffee chocolate in the nose. Dark brown with tan lace. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with a chocolate dusting. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I would easily have it again which is
  high praise these days. It almost made me forget life death and the certainty of
  dentistry. 01/05/2020 second sipping.  Still good but not as sweet as I remember. '
