| **Comments** | Poured black with tan cream lace top. Vanilla milkshake aroma. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with vanilla coffee and chocolate malt evident. Palate is thin to medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. A pleasant milk stout and my nod to Burns and my Jacobite ancestry! |
