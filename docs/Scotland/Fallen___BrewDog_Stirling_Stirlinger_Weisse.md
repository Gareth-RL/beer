| **Comments** | Aroma has tropical hops pineapple and lychee. Pours hazy pale yellow with thin lace top. Taste is medium bitter to sour. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light sweet finish. Overall it was fine but not what I expected as a Weisse. But then that is no vice. |
