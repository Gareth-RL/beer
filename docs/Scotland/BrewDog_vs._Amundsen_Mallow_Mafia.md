| **Comments** | Aroma has marshmallow and chocolate the kind you get when you open a certain wrapped proprietary biscuit (why advertise a brand for free?) It is regulation expresso brown and any lace is too fleeting to warrant spelling. Taste is sweet with little to separate you from your marshmallow except the ice-cream of your mind. Palate is surprisingly medium to less in body terms (at least for me), because the texture is not as sticky as many others, carbonation is soft to flat, and the finish is long but on the one note (with that slight soprano recital sense of will she let it go? To sample two double imperial collaborations was folly, but life needs these odd pieces to make the mosaic work. This is not a conclusion but a hypothesis. |
