| **Comments** | Nutty malt with a hint of spice. Pours clear ruby amber body and thin off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with chili interference. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and of course chili. Can't help wondering what it would taste like without the pickle?  |
