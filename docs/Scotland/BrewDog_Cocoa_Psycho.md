Beer: BrewDog Cocoa Psycho
BeerID: 194513
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap. Pours dark brown deep tan lacing. Aroma has roasty, caramel, chocolate,
  coffee, malts, alcohol, raisin, and maybe, lets underline themaybe, something medicinal
  that is not rubbing alcohol. Taste is medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly
  sour, as the cocoa does its thing. Palate is the medium side of full, creamy, slick
  feel, soft carbonation, long finish, but like holding a single note.  I drank two
  Russian Imperial Stouts to commemorate the October Revolution. Objectively I side
  with the Bolsheviks although I may have been drawn to  Bakunin. Either way the Russian
  Imperial Stout needs a revolution. Neither Polish nor Scottish samples made me feel
  like storming the winter palace. 08/06/2020 Second sipping while still awaiting
  the revolution. Not as sweet from the can but still strong with licorice noted as
  the medicinal quality I pondered back in the day. I wish there were smaller cans
  of the high octane stuff.
