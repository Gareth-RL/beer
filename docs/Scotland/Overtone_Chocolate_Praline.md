Brewer: Overtone Brewing Co.
City: Glasgow
Comments: Can from HonestBrew. Poured cola black with rapidly diminishing tan lace.
  Aroma is rather synthetic vanilla marshmallow and chocolate malt. Taste is medium
  to full sweet with the same marshmallow notes. The artificial taste is particularly
  pronounced in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average
  carbonation and a carbonated sugar finish. Not great.
