Comments: '"Tap @Nottingham Brewdog. Pours golden amber with thin lace top. Mine was
  clear so no haziness or cloudiness noted by other reviews. Aroma hay, herbs, ginger,
  and lemon grass. Taste is medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, umami
  finish &#40;I guess that is the pepper.&#41; It certainly had more&quot;attitude&quot;
  than other Saison I&#39;ve had lately."'
