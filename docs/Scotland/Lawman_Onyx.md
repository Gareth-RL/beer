Comments: '"@nottingham beer festival. Aroma is muted coffee and chocoloate. Appearance
  is dark brown with thin tan lace. The taste is medium bitter and medium sweet. Palate
  has flat carbonation, medium body, and a smooth texture and languorous finish. Overall,
  good and flavour filled with a richness that comes through to the end."'
