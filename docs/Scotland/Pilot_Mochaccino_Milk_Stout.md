| **Comments** | Tap @brewdog Nottingham. Pours dark with tan cream top. Aroma has coffee caramel chocolate, vanilla, raisin, so all one can want from a sweet  milk stout. Taste is medium to full sweet with a background bitterness that never really asserts itself. Palate is medium body, creamy, sticky, feel, soft carbonation, edging towards flat and a lazy rather than long finish with flicks of bitterness. I could face an Edinburgh winter night with one of these in my belly. 22/10/23 I had better taste buds 6 years ago. But it's still good  |
