| **Comments** | The scent is malted. Pours reddish amber with spotted cream top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a cereal note. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. The bitterness intensified successive sips which complimented the sweet malts quite nicely. |
