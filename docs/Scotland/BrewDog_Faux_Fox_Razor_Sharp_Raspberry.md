| **Comments** | Raspberries and yoghurt aroma. Poured red berry bodied with pink lacing. Taste is front loaded raspberry but with definite lactose follow up. Palate is light to medium bodied fizzy carbonation and sour milk finish. It depends on how you like your raspberries. For me the lactose and fizz detracted and I was unable to sense a beer even a Berliner style sour. But refreshing. |
