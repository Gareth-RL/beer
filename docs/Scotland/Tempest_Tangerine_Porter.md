| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours dark almost black body and thin tan top. Aroma is dark malts and yes some chocolate and tangerine &#40;we are already in chocolate orange territory.&#41; Taste is medium sweet to more since the tangerine is evident in a murky kind of way.  Palate is no more than medium bodied, texture just sticky rather than creamy and carbonation average and the finish is slightly &#40;underlined&#41; sour. So if Terry&#39;s confectionery is insufficient drink this. |
