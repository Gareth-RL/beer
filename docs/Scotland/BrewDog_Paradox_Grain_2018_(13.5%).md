Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: '"Tap at Brewdog Nottingham. Pours dark with tan head dissipating to halo.
  Aroma has whiskey grain, vanilla and caramel notes. Taste is medium to full sweet
  to bitter. More molasses than caramel and smoky with edges of coffee bitterness.
  A haiku of a stout. A lot in a little. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture with
  some heat, carbonation is average to soft, finish is alcoholic and luxurious. A
  commanding imperial stout but as always the questions - could anyone drink this
  regularly in pint form &#40;no&#41; and what could possibly follow &#40;a rest&#41;."'
