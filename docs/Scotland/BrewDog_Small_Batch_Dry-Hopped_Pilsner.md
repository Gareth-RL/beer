Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours clear golden with thin lace top. Aroma
  is resinous and herbal hop with cheese or leather undertone. Taste is dry bitter
  with a crisp astringent finish. Good but a reminder of why Pilsner has never ranked
  among my favorites.
