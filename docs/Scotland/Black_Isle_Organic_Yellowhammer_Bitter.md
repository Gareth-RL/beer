Beer: Black Isle Organic Yellowhammer Bitter
BeerID: 24250
Brewer: Black Isle Brewing
City: Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty
Comments: Bottle at Henderson’s vegan restaurant Edinburgh. Aroma is grassy and grapefruity.
  Pours clear honey gold with a white top and light lacing. The taste is medium sweet.
  Full fruited with a pale malts spine. Medium carbonation with a lasting sourness
  and an oily finish on the palate. A refreshing summer ale on one of those rare Scottish
  evenings where there is a strange yellow orb in the sky.
