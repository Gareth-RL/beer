| **Comments** | Bottle at Hendersonâ€™s vegan restaurant Edinburgh. Aroma is grassy and grapefruity. Pours clear honey gold with a white top and light lacing. The taste is medium sweet. Full fruited with a pale malts spine. Medium carbonation with a lasting sourness and an oily finish on the palate. A refreshing summer ale on one of those rare Scottish evenings where there is a strange yellow orb in the sky. |
