Comments: Aroma has roasted dark malts with mocha note. Pours dark with tan cream
  head initially disappearing to broken lace. Taste is medium sweet, to lightly bitter
  with some fruit in the mouth. Palate is thin to medium bodied slick feel average
  carbonation and a long finish.  This works for me..
