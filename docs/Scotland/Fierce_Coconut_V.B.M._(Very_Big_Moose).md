Beer: Fierce Coconut V.B.M. (Very Big Moose)
BeerID: 681421
Brewer: Fierce Beer Co
City: Dyce, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Aroma is coconut in milk chocolate with a flame of alcohol behind.  Pouring
  black body and tan lacing. Taste is full sweet with milk chocolate melting from
  coconut to brandy burn. Palate is medium to full bodied, caramel feel, soft carbonation,
  and an alcoholic afterburn. As with other imperial stouts of the sweetshop variety,
  this appeals to my inner child, but is it really beer?
