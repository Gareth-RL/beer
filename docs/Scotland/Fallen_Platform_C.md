Beer: Fallen Platform C
BeerID: 278700
Brewer: Fallen Brewing
City: Kippen, Stirlingshire
Comments: Tap. A beer that becomes more impressive. Pours copper and a little cloudy
  with a white foam top. Aroma citrus hops and caramel malt. This yields a grapefruit
  zest savour and a toffee smoothness that is remarkable. Palate is medium bodied
  carbonation soft and texture is slick but the finish is long and bitter. I liked
  it more than I expected.
