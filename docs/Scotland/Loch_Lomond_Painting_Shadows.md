| **Comments** | Can from Lidl. Pours dark brown almost black with thin tan lace. Aroma has some pine hop notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with hints of licorice especially in the finish. Medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. The dark malts take it well away from IPA territory in my view but it is still a decent ale. Not sure one can boast of homegrown Scottish water (if you're a Scottish brewery, where else would it be from?) |
