| **Comments** | Dark malted with coffee notes but hops and herbs lurk. Pours dark brown with tan lace halo. Taste is an excellent blend of sweet caramel malt, rye sourness and bitter hops. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel, full to average carbonation, and a subtle bittersweet finish. Interesting porter. 16/12/19 second sipping confirms this as a better than average imperial porter |
