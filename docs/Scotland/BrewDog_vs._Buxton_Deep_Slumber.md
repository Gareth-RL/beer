Beer: BrewDog vs. Buxton Deep Slumber
BeerID: 714230
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Dark malted with coffee notes but hops and herbs lurk. Pours dark brown
  with tan lace halo. Taste is an excellent blend of sweet caramel malt, rye sourness
  and bitter hops. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel, full to average carbonation,
  and a subtle bittersweet finish. Interesting porter. 16/12/19 second sipping confirms
  this as a better than average imperial porter
