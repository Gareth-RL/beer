| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours reddish amber with bubbly halo. Aroma has cereal, bread, and fruit gum.Taste light to medium sour with a curdled milk edge. Palate is medium bodied but oily and sticky texture adds weight, carbonation soft, finish lactic. I shall not head this way again since the aftertaste is like tea with spoiled milk. |
