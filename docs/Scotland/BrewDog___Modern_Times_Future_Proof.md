Beer: BrewDog / Modern Times Future Proof
BeerID: 814225
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Poured pale golden with thin lace. Aroma has citrus and peach and papaya
  but not the promised mango, although alliteration continued with a piney note. Taste
  is medium sweet to lightly bitter with quite a brisk transition and a dry finish.
  Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and dry bitter finish.
  Overall a tasty IPA although nothing seems future proof at the moment.
