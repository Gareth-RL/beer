| **Comments** | Tap. Pours yellow gold with thin white lace top. Broken lacing. Aroma citrus and pine. Taste medium bitter with fruity flavours but the bitterness predominates. As befits an IPA this has a fairly crisp finish. Another ideal garden beer for the summer or a way of weaning students off cheap lager. |
