Comments: A sign of the times. The first time I have had to enter a Brewdog beer on Ratebeer. Pours amber body thin lace top. Aroma toffee malt. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter plenty of sweet malt before the transition to lightly bitter finish. Thin to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It won't displace outstanding Red ales but it will serve.
