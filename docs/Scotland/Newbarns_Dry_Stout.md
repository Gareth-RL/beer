Comments: 'Poured dark brown body almost black with tan swirl top. Aroma of berry
  hop and roasted malts with several subnotes. Medium sweet to bitter with coffee
  and chocolate initially then nutty and fruity finish. Light to medium bodied watery
  texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. All not helped by an icy
  keg. It might be rated higher in optimal conditions. But given that I stopped off
  for a different stout entirely, I am not complaining '
