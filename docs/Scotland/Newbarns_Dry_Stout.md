| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body almost black with tan swirl top. Aroma of berry hop and roasted malts with several subnotes. Medium sweet to bitter with coffee and chocolate initially then nutty and fruity finish. Light to medium bodied watery texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. All not helped by an icy keg. It might be rated higher in optimal conditions. But given that I stopped off for a different stout entirely, I am not complaining                                                                                       |
