Comments: '"Tap. Aroma is predictably formidable. Sherry and fruit cake come to mind.
  It pours a very reddish brown looking more like port. Taste is obviously towards
  the sweet but not as far as one might assume. Medium rather than heavy for me. The
  caramelized malts add to the rich velvety smoothness rather than the sweetness.
  Palate has to be full body, given all that is going on. Texture is both thick feel,
  and creamy texture. It&#39;s blatantly boozy. A long finish and if you are wise
  - no driving. The best barleywine so far. The life is young."'
