| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Single hop IPA based on earlier IPA recipe. Pours clear rich brown amber with thin white lace halo. Aroma has familiar earthy, herbal, fruit properties that makes it an easier solo choice. Not as tropical as some it melds well with the pale malts. Taste is medium bitter with a hint of butterscotch. Palate is medium bodied, texture somewhere between oily and sticky with even a grainy note &#40;unless the glass needed an extra rinse&#41;. Carbonation average to soft. Finish is soft and slightly sour. Overall I have been more disappointed by other attempts to play a tune on a single string. |
