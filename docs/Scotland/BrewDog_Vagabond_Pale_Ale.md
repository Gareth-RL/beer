| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy amber copper with thin lace. Aroma is caramelized malts soft berry fruits with floral notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a languorous malty finish. If someone asks what is an American Pale, this is. But better specimens can be found. |
