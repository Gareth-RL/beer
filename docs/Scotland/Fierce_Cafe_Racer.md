| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee with tan foam halo. Aroma has roasty, coffee bean, vanilla, and cake. Rich. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter dark chocolate bitter. Palate is medium bodied, creamy, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall, this is just what a coffee porter should be. 20/09/24 Tap at Canal house. Given how much I  liked it in 2018, it's been a while. My words then ring true now. |
