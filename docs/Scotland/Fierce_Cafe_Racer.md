Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee with tan foam halo. Aroma has
  roasty, coffee bean, vanilla, and cake. Rich. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with
  the latter dark chocolate bitter. Palate is medium bodied, creamy, soft carbonation,
  long finish. Overall, this is just what a coffee porter should be. 20/09/24 Tap
  at Canal house. Given how much I  liked it in 2018, it''s been a while. My words
  then ring true now."'
