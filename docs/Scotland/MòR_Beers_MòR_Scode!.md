Comments: '"Bottle. Poured clear golden amber body with white lacing; fizzy enough
  to escape on bottle opening. But settled with lacing rather than foam, even if the
  flow of bubbles to the surface was hot-tub-like. Aroma is citric hops and pale malt
  with no honey detected by my olfactory functions. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  sour with a slight marmalade back-note. Palate is medium to light, the mouth-coating
  texture and the prominent fizz offset each other somewhat, there''s a sour mash
  finish. I wanted to like this more than I do. Overcabonated and the transition from
  lemon citrus to sour mash is not one I''d recommend. Shame-a neat name wasted!"'
