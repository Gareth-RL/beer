| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma chocolate coffee and cinnamon spice. Pours dark with tan swirl of lace. The taste has the vanilla and chilies which causes some confusing as the tongue is sparked and soothed simultaneously. Carbonation is flat as the chili provide the fizz. Body is full and the finish is languorous. A rich dessert indeed. |
