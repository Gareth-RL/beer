Brewer: Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK)
City: Edinburgh
Comments: For a spiced ale, this one has subdued aroma. From cask it pour amber, thin
  head, broken lacing. The coriander and lemongrass add edge to the biscuity malts
  but not in a way that overpowers. Medium body with some residual bitterness. For
  a special ale unspectacular.
