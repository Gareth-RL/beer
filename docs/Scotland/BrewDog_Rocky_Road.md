Comments: A pastry stout indeed. Aroma of jammy marshmallow.  Pours black body tan halo.  Full sweet with the only light bitterness coming from chocolate notes, but these are eclipsed by raspberry fruit and vanilla candy. Thin, but sticky, average carbonation, and a sweet finish to match the start. One should not complain,  even if the synthetic sweet notes a overwhelming.  It promises just that. And the 6.8% abv slips by.
