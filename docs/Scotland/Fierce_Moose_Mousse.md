Brewer: Fierce Beer Co
City: Dyce, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at the Canal House. Pours black with a tan coffee foam top. Aroma has
  lots of milk chocolate with some berry fruits. Taste is medium to more sweet to
  bitter chocolate notes. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture more milk than cream,
  carbonation average, and a  languid finish. Overall, the abv may be session levels
  but unless you are the kind of person who eats chocolate by the kilo, one will be
  enough.
