Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours black coffee with tan lace top.
  Aroma is dark fruits and alcohol with the strength listed on the board as 9.5% so
  maybe newer batches are scaling down. Not as full on in scent as some, it&#39;s
  a beer for the mouth rather than the nose and that collides with a certain raw booziness.
  It still has enough smoothness to guide it through. Taste is dark fruit and chocolate
  malt with the latter edging the bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture,
  with some souring on the tongue, carbonation is average and might be reduced, and
  the finish is long and bitter. Overall it doesn&#39;t use the spectrum it potentially
  has: Good but not great."'
