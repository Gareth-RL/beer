| **Comments** | Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange with white lace diminishing. Aroma is full of citrus fruit orange and maybe ripe mango but this obliterates the malts. Given the scope offered within the Imperial domain, the look and palate are very good but not excellent. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied but with a definite sticky texture that mimics fuller bodied beer, carbonation average, and a lingering ambivalent finish. So good rather than great. |
