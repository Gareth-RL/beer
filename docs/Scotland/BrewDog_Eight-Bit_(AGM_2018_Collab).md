Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: BrewDog Eight-Bit (AGM 2018 Collab)
BeerID: 614606
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange with white lace diminishing.
  Aroma is full of citrus fruit orange and maybe ripe mango but this obliterates the
  malts. Given the scope offered within the Imperial domain, the look and palate are
  very good but not excellent. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium
  bodied but with a definite sticky texture that mimics fuller bodied beer, carbonation
  average, and a lingering ambivalent finish. So good rather than great.
