| **Comments** | Tap. Pours elegantly black with creamy tan top. Aroma has chocolate, coffee, vanilla, herbs. It's a stout. Taste is smooth, creamy like cappuccino. And medium sweetness, there's a light bitter finish but no sourness at all. Palate is full bodied creamy, flat, long finish. In short, the milk stout for me. 23/11/19 second sipping still a very solid example of a milk stout in my opinion. Not improve on nitro.  |
