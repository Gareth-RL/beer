Comments: '"Tap. Pours elegantly black with creamy tan top. Aroma has chocolate, coffee,
  vanilla, herbs. It''s a stout. Taste is smooth, creamy like cappuccino. And medium
  sweetness, there''s a light bitter finish but no sourness at all. Palate is full
  bodied creamy, flat, long finish. In short, the milk stout for me. 23/11/19 second
  sipping still a very solid example of a milk stout in my opinion. Not improve on
  nitro. "'
