| **Comments** | Aroma has tangerine, although at second sniff it could be satsuma. Poured hazy cloudy golden pale body with white lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I applaud the smoothness but it lacks something. 1 June 2020 second sipping. Can. Certainly the appearance and aroma are the same, and this time I will opt firmly for satsuma. My palate has yet to detect the kiwi and lychee notes that marketeers do. But it's an easy drinking pale and that was what I wanted. |
