| **Comments** | Aroma has burnt coconut, roasted dark malt and a vague metallic note. Poured dark brown body dusty cocoa foam top. Taste is medium sweet with the expected Bounty note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish with an odd chalky note. Somehow the parts don't add to a whole. |
