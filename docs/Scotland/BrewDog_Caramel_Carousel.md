| **Comments** | Poured Dark brown tan lace top. Aroma dark malts some caramel and chocolate noted. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more caramel and some berry notes. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A decent dark imperial if modest for the abv. Second sipping during lockdown and noted as King's Shilling.  No lace on a brown pouring.  Still a maltbread and caramel scent.  Still makes me appreciate my Macpherson ancestry. |
