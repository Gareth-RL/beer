| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours golden thin lace halo. Aroma has pithy hop and sour mash. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a lightly sour finish. Overall it confirmed my ambivalence about Saison. Neither fish nor fowl. |
