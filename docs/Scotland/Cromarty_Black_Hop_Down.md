| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours murky dark brown with thin tan top. Aroma is roasted malts, piny herbal hop. Taste is medium bitter with a sour edge. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average to soft carbonation, and long finish. For me, it had a forward flourish with a lot of the flavour evident initially and briefly and then a lasting malt note. Objectively very sound of its type but I won&#39;t hurry back. |
