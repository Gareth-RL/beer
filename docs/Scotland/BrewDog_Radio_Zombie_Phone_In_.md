| **Comments** | Aroma has predictable boozy coffee and licorice. Pours black with tan cream top. Taste is medium to full sweet which works against the heat which leads to a relatively raw boozy finish. Palate is medium some stickiness but also the rough boozy edge. The more I sipped and pondered, the more the score fell. Not bad, but other imperial stout manages the challenge of 14% better. |
