BeerID: 674814
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Aroma has predictable boozy coffee and licorice. Pours black with tan cream
  top. Taste is medium to full sweet which works against the heat which leads to a
  relatively raw boozy finish. Palate is medium some stickiness but also the rough
  boozy edge. The more I sipped and pondered, the more the score fell. Not bad, but
  other imperial stout manages the challenge of 14% better.
