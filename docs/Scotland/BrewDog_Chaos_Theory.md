| **Comments** | Poured clear amber body with thin lace top. Aroma had grapefruit and resinous pine. Taste is medium sweet to dry bitterness with a definite quench in the finish.  Palate is medium bodied oily texture smooth   average carbonation and a bitter drying finish.  A very solid IPA Second sipping 23/06/20 still solid and good. |
