Comments: 'Tap at Nottingham. Pours orange body halo of lace and scrabbled thin top.
  Aroma is all that is claimed across the fruits pineapple mango guava nectarines
  peach - it smells like five a day. Taste is medium to light sweet to sour. Lighter
  than expected. Palate is similarly modest medium to light bodied despite some stickiness
  in texture, carbonation is average, and the finish is like toothpaste in feel if
  not in flavours. A nice beer if not suited to my winter instincts '
