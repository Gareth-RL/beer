| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours pale yellow largely clear body white lace. Aroma lime floral, herbs, and of course resinous. Taste is medium to more bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation, and dry finish. Not a lager fan so this is me enthusiastic. |
