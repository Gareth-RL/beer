Comments: '"Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours amber gold with lasting white
  lace. Aroma is a puzzle as whatever the lime does it merges with herbal and pine
  hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Good but watch the abv&#033;"'
