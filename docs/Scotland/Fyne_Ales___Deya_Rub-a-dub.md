| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours amber gold with lasting white lace. Aroma is a puzzle as whatever the lime does it merges with herbal and pine hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good but watch the abv&#033; |
