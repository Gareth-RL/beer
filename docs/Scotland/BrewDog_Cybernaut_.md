| **Comments** | Tap at The Brewdog Nottingham. Pours orange golden with thin white lace halo. Aroma has pithy citrus ruby grapefruit. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, fizzy carbonation, and this thins the finish. A bit too fizzy and thin for me but if the sun is shining it will flow easily. |
