Beer: 'BrewDog Cybernaut '
BeerID: 613588
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at The Brewdog Nottingham. Pours orange golden with thin white lace
  halo. Aroma has pithy citrus ruby grapefruit. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, fizzy carbonation, and this thins the finish. A
  bit too fizzy and thin for me but if the sun is shining it will flow easily.
