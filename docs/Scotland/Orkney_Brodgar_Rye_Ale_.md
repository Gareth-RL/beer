| **Comments** | Decent blend of toffee malt and rye spice in the scent. Pours rich amber with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet with spice transition to medium bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent red rye and another Orcadian tick. |
