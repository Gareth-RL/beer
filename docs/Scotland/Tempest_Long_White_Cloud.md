| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours cloudy yellow gold with lace halo. Aroma has grapefruit zest peach and melon. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, finish softly bitter. A pretty average pale although it may suffer a little by the absence of sun, cheer, and money. |
