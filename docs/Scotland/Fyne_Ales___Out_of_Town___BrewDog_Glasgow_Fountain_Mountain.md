Comments: '"Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours golden with thin white lace circle top.
  Aroma lemon, hay, gooseberry with a.little chalk. Taste is medium bitter with a
  sour edge. Acerbic. Palate is light to medium body, thin feel, average carbonation,
  and astringent, finish. Maybe it&#39;s the aftertaste that damns it for me, but
  I am not a fan."'
