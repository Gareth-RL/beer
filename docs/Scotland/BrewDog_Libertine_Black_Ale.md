BeerID: 171238
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog. Pours decidedly black with tan lacing. Aroma has the citrus
  hops that makes this a new style IPA but it is emphatically black. Like porter,
  the black IPA is tricky especially in the taste. This is medium to light bitter
  with a mild sourness. Palate is medium to light body, thinnish feel, and a sour
  finish. But in the style it is more than solid.
