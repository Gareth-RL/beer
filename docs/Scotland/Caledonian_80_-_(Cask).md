Beer: Caledonian 80/- (Cask)
BeerID: 46762
Brewer: Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK)
City: Edinburgh
Comments: Cask. Under the name Edinburgh Castle. Aroma of roasted malts and stone
  fruits. Chestnut brown with white foam head. Tastes earthy, malty and rich with
  a pleasantly refreshing aeration and cereal finish. I’m glad to get some more Caledonian
  beers down in Nottingham since only a few places keep Deuchars IPA and the bitter
  and stout are equally session worthy.
