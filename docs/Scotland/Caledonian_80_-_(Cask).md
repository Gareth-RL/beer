| **Comments** | Cask. Under the name Edinburgh Castle. Aroma of roasted malts and stone fruits. Chestnut brown with white foam head. Tastes earthy, malty and rich with a pleasantly refreshing aeration and cereal finish. Iâ€™m glad to get some more Caledonian beers down in Nottingham since only a few places keep Deuchars IPA and the bitter and stout are equally session worthy. |
