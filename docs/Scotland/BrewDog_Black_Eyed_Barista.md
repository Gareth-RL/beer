| **Comments** | Dark coffee malts scent no maple syrup in the aroma. Poured dark mahogany body with thin tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a little heat in the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a warming alcohol finish. A decent sweet stout but the maple syrup appellation seems gratuitous. And I think the same flavour could be obtained at a lower abv - all 10% adds is duty and heat. |
