| **Comments** | Tap. Never was a beer more aptly named. Aroma is berrific. Raspberry and blackberries compete for attention. Pours red to cloudy purple with a white halo. Taste has a medium sweetness to offset the mounting sourness. It reminded me of Vimto popsicles from childhood &#40;so very middle class&#41;. Palate medium body, sticky, lively, long finish, astringent, but this doesn&#39;t capture it. For a novice like me, a revelation. |
