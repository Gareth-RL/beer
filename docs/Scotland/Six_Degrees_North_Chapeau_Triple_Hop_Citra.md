| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy caramel gold with thin white lace. Aroma has spice, banana and bread. Taste is medium to full bitter with light sweet sour notes in the background. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, and a long bitter finish. At some points it tasted like an APA that went astray. |
