| **Comments** | Tap. Definite aromatic hints of the raspberries in the jammy nose. Pours amber with barely a head. The taste is no more than bitter sweet which might be a blessing for those wary of fruit beers of this kind. The raspberry flavor lingers but there is ample bitterness and sourness as well. Medium body, and soft carbonation with a pleasant languor in the finish. Overall, a brave effort. |
