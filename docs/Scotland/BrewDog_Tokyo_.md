Comments: '"Bottle at home &#40;it has been staring at me for a while&#41;. Pours
  clear coke black with minimal halo of tan lacing. Aroma has coffee, herbs, leather,
  alcohol, and something that I guess is jasmine. The cranberries elude me &#40;they
  always do except in cranberry juice&#41;. Taste is medium sweetness, salty, with
  a background bitterness. Nothing sour about this beast. Palate has medium to full
  body, oily rather than creamy texture to my mind, soft to flat carbonation, and
  a long finish while your head accepts that this is a beer stronger than many a wine
  glass. Overall, one has to commend the containment of alcoholic heat, since too
  many high octane beers threaten to damage the esophagus. But does it explore the
  range of its palate: along the divergent dark malt and fruity fringes, I suspect
  it does but not overwhelmingly so; else it would crash through the 4 barrier."'
