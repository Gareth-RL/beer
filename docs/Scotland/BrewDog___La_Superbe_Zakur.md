| **Comments** | Poured ruby dark chestnut body with off white lace. Aroma has roasted malts and dark fruits . Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter although it's a blurred transition some aniseed notes. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent Baltic style lager |
