| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours dark black body some chocolate foam. Aroma roasted chocolate malt coffee licorice and resin. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and long finish. A beer that deserves a decent fireplace and a howling gale outside. |
