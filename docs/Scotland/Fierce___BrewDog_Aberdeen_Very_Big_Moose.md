Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black with tan lace circle. Aroma is all one
  expects - richly chocolate malt, vanilla and spice. Taste is medium to full sweetness
  with some dark chocolate bitterness behind. Palate is full bodied and creamy with
  a little soft carbonation, and a languor like a fine liquor. This Xmas let a very
  big moose loose about your house&#033;"'
