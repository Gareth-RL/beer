Comments: '"Cask. Aroma has milk coffee, vanilla, and hints of caramel like a bog
  standard cappuccino. Pours copper brown with tan cream head. Taste is medium to
  heavy cloying sweetness, and other flavours like bitterness are relegated which
  is not what most beer drinkers expect. Having said all that, I have certainly tasted
  worse. And it may be ideal for watching Sweden thrash Luxembourg while the rain
  pours outside a Wetherspoons. 17/06/18 this time I am watching Mexico v Germany
  and it&#39;s a closer game  which is maybe why the beer tastes better."'
