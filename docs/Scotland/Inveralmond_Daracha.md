| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has milk coffee, vanilla, and hints of caramel like a bog standard cappuccino. Pours copper brown with tan cream head. Taste is medium to heavy cloying sweetness, and other flavours like bitterness are relegated which is not what most beer drinkers expect. Having said all that, I have certainly tasted worse. And it may be ideal for watching Sweden thrash Luxembourg while the rain pours outside a Wetherspoons. 17/06/18 this time I am watching Mexico v Germany and it&#39;s a closer game  which is maybe why the beer tastes better. |
