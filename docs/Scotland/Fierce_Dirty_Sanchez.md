| **Comments** | Aroma of chocolate malts and red chili. Poured cola body with fading tan lacing. The taste is medium sweet caramel malt initially and then chili spice before lapsing into a warm licorice bitterness. I can't say the smoke care through for me. The palate was medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation and a long chili spice burn in the tail. Given the clear promise of chili one can hardly complain when it is delivered, although for me it did make the back half of the drink less enjoyable than the front. It would be interesting to see how this went down in Mexico. |
