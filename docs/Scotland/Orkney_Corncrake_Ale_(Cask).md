| **Comments** | Cask. Pours clear golden with white foam lacing. Aroma has floral hops and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate has medium body, sticky texture, average carbonation, sweet finish with a hint of rosebud. If I am honest I bought thto have an Orcadian beer at a pub that has a Â£2.50 a pint offer on Friday early evening. So you get what you deserve. |
