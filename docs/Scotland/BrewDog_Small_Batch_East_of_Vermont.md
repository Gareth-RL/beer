Comments: '"Tap at Brew Dog. Pours hazy murky golden orange with thin lace halo. Aroma
  is mango peach and pink grapefruit. Taste is medium sweet to sour with some spice
  although the lactose softens this. Palate consequently is easily medium with slightly
  creamy texture average carbonation and a long sour spicy finish that works remarkably
  well. I guess Glasgow is east of Vermont although not on a straight line. &#40;that
  latitude is all Canadian&#41;. "'
