| **Comments** | Poured black body tan lace top. Aroma of roasted ashy malts. Medium sweet to bitter with a long finish. Medium to light body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It's symptomatic of Brewdog's direction that this is a self proclaimed Guinness substitute. In those terms it's okay but I don't like Guinness  |
