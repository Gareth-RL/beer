| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma&#045;&#045;its best feature is certainly spicy and fruity and its appearance is fair although more chestnut than ruby with a bubbly white top. But beer is the taste and this one is muffled and incoherent rather than complex. The sweet notes predominate against a jarring undertow of dry bitterness that is at its best in the finish. I suspect most drinkers respond more to the taste than the swallow in terms of favoring ale. Given the style and the brewery - a disappointment. |
