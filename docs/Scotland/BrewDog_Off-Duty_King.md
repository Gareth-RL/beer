| **Comments** | Poured black bodied with tan halo lacing. Aroma is rich, caramel, vanilla bourbon, raisin and boozy fruitcake. Taste is sweet because of the dark malts that yield the caramel and the ageing has accentuated the fruit. The booziness softens in the taste so that the finish is not hot like some imperials. It seems to capture many of the features that an imperial should deliver in terms of complexity and length of flavour. Palate is medium to full with sticky texture and soft carbonation. There is a long and slowly embittering finish (a bit like this review). Certainly the most impressive beer of my lockdown! But then again it has not been wise to head solo into the Imperial selection.  I would have happily shared this with someone who appreciated it provided they were COVID-free., masked, gloved, a family member, and they brought their own glass and had signed a petition to have Dominic Cummings publicly flogged. You guessed it: I drank alone. |
