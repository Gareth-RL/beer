Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours orange golden. Off white lace. Aroma has toast,and
  marmalade bourbon rye.  Taste  medium sour and lightly bitter with only a fleeting
  sweetness. Palate medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, sour soft finish.
  Good enough but the Bourbon hasn&#39;t added much."'
