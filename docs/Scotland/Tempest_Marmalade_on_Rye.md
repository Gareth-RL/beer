| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours orange golden. Off white lace. Aroma has toast,and marmalade bourbon rye.  Taste  medium sour and lightly bitter with only a fleeting sweetness. Palate medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, sour soft finish. Good enough but the Bourbon hasn&#39;t added much. |
