City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap. Aroma tropical fruits and grapefruit pith with pine notes. Pours amber
  orange gold. Lace top. The taste is citrus loaded and so goes predictably medium
  strong sweet then medium strong bitter with a slightly sour finish. For me this
  is a summer ale which would properly confine its native consumption to only a few
  weeks each year. Second sipping 26/05/20 less impressive from the can but at least
  the sun was shining. Third sipping 20/07/20 eminently drinkable.
