Comments: '"Cask at the Sir Joseph Else. Pours amber brown with white lace top. Aroma
  is spicy, but roasted malt comes through. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. There&#39;s
  a hint of fireside about it, but alas no fire in this city centre Spoons."'
