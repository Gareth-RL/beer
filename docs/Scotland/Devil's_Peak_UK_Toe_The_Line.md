Brewer: '"Devil&#39;s Peak UK"'
City: Dyce, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Tap. Pours a cloudy hazy orange gold with a white foam top. Aroma is not
  as explosive as the marketing suggests. Mango yeh, grapefruit lightly, but the tropical
  fruit stocks are safe. Also hay and cereal malt in there. This means the taste is
  softer and more generally muted than most IPA. But it grew on me. And probably my
  first South African beer.
