| **Comments** | Tap. Pours a cloudy hazy orange gold with a white foam top. Aroma is not as explosive as the marketing suggests. Mango yeh, grapefruit lightly, but the tropical fruit stocks are safe. Also hay and cereal malt in there. This means the taste is softer and more generally muted than most IPA. But it grew on me. And probably my first South African beer. |
