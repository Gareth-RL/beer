| **Comments** | Cask at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours dark amber with off white lace top. Aroma has pine and grapefruit zest and even strawberry jam. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a strong bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and said bitter end. Classic IPA in my view |
