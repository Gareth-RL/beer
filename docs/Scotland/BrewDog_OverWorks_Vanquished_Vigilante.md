Comments: '"Complex aroma that marries mango funk, grapefruit zest and toffee malt.
  Pours a predictably murky orange brown with ephemeral lacing. Taste is initially
  mango plum sweetness before a tart rush sours the tongue like the inner skin of
  a pomegranate. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and
  a long sour/bitter fruity finish. So if sour is something you go to for flavour
  gymnastics, this is your sort of thing. Oh and don''t forget the apples that you
  smelt at the start, where are they now?"'
