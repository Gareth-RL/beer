| **Comments** | Tap at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Aroma has a lot beginning with the rye, resin, citrus and caramel. Your nose may just close into a cheesy scent. Pours reddish brown with broken lacing. Taste is medium bitter ultimately but there are sweet and sour notes in there too. Palate is medium bodied, and I guess I would settle on oily for the texture, carbonation average but unobtrusive, and the finish is suspenseful but modestly bitter. Possibly the best Brew Dog I have tried. |
