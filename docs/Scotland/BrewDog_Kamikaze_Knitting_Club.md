Comments: '"Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with broken tan lacing. Aroma
  gas licorice, coconut and smoke. Taste is medium sweet to full ashy bitterness.
  The maple syrup is more on the label than either the nose or tongue. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily feel, average carbonation and yes, slightly ashy finish. So I won&#39;t
  be taking up knitting."'
