| **Comments** | Poured amber body thin lace diminishing to halo. Aroma of slightly roasted malts breast with hint of caramel.  Taste medium sweet to bitter pleasant malted flavours but a bit monotone. Palate medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light finish. This is my kind of lager but there are better examples  |
