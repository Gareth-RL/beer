Beer: BrewDog Walking Dead Rambling Society
BeerID: 740138
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: Lively grapefruit melon grassy scent. Pours golden with white lace top.
  Taste is medium sweet to dry bitterness which seems so drying as to leave an absence
  in the mouth where taste should be. Palate therefore is medium to zero with a dry
  tongue finish. Perhaps begin with this and everything thereafter is a plus. No like.
