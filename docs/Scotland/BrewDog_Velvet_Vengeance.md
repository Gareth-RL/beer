Beer: BrewDog Velvet Vengeance
BeerID: 719987
Brewer: BrewDog
City: Ellon, Aberdeenshire
Comments: A definite cocoa chocolate nose. Poured black with diminishing tan foam
  top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a warming boozy backnote. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish. I like
  this more than Zombie Cake and by more than 1.1%abv but why? I suspect it is because
  it wears its chocolate on its sleeve as us oldies tend to do.
