Comments: 'Poured dark brown, almost black body tan lace swirl.  Aroma of rich coffee
  chocolate vanilla and smoke. Medium sweet to bitter with chocolate coffee toffee
  dark fruits and a resonant dark chocolate finish.  Medium bodied smooth texture
  soft carbonation and a bitter finish with well managed alcohol since this batch
  had matured to 10.5%abv. A third was enough '
