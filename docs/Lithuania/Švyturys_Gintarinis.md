Comments: '"Bottle from Mansfield Rd convenience store. Aroma has grainy note and
  not a lot else. Poured golden body with white lace top. Taste is bready, sweet to
  bitter with a doughy quality that I don''t associate with Pils. Palate is medium
  bodied, texture is flour coating (the antithesis of crisp), carbonation is average
  to high. I don''t like lager but ironically that seems to make me more tolerant
  than many on RB who have given this a far lower rating. Not surprised that it is
  part of the Carlsberg empire and perhaps that explains the vehemence with which
  our Scandinavian colleagues reject it."'
