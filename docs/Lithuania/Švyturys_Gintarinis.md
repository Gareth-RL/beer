| **Comments** | Bottle from Mansfield Rd convenience store. Aroma has grainy note and not a lot else. Poured golden body with white lace top. Taste is bready, sweet to bitter with a doughy quality that I don't associate with Pils. Palate is medium bodied, texture is flour coating (the antithesis of crisp), carbonation is average to high. I don't like lager but ironically that seems to make me more tolerant than many on RB who have given this a far lower rating. Not surprised that it is part of the Carlsberg empire and perhaps that explains the vehemence with which our Scandinavian colleagues reject it. |
