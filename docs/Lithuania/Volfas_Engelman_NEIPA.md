| **Comments**  | Poured hazy golden body off white lace with yeast spots.  Aroma is its strong suit as it meets the NEIPA expectations of tropical fruit hop scents = pineapple mango and grapefruit. Taste is less rich with mango mixed with pine resin.  Palate is medium bodied chalky gassy with a muted bitter finish. But for 1.68. a can it's a bargain Lithuanian beer from an Italian supermarket.                                                                                       |
