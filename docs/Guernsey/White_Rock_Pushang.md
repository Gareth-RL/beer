Comments: '"Nottingham Beer festival 2018. I fancied a Guernsey pint. Pours yellow
  gold thin lace. Aroma is mainly grassy herbal hops. Taste is medium bitter to lightly
  sweet and sour. The palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation,
  and a sour finish. I wish I had some Guernsey sunshine to go with it&#033;"'
