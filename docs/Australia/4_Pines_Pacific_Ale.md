| **Comments** | Bottle. No big aroma and certainly not floral to my nose but some faint pineapple and passionfruit detected. Pours pale golden body with dissipating lace top. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter with slightly dry finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and dry finish. Unimpressed. |
