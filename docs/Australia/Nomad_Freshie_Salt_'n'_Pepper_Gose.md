Brewer: Nomad Brewing Company
City: Brookvale
Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy to cloudy yellow with white lace
  top. Aroma lemon coriander and I guess pepper. Taste is juicy medium sweet to sour.
  Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a finish that stains
  the palate. I would argue against seawater as a base ingredient for beer in principle
  but hope to survive.
