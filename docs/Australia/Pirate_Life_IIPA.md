| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has melon and citrus with pine notes in the background. Pours golden amber with cream head and broken lace. Taste has an excellent balance between fruity tropical hops and sweet biscuit malts. Thereâ€™s even some extra elements in the finish with some pleasing bitterness in the finale. An Australian beer that equals their great wine. |
