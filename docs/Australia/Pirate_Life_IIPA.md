Beer: Pirate Life IIPA
BeerID: 326214
Brewer: Pirate Life Brewing (CUB- Asahi)
City: Adelaide
Comments: Tap. Aroma has melon and citrus with pine notes in the background. Pours
  golden amber with cream head and broken lace. Taste has an excellent balance between
  fruity tropical hops and sweet biscuit malts. There’s even some extra elements in
  the finish with some pleasing bitterness in the finale. An Australian beer that
  equals their great wine.
