| **Comments** | Bottle. Caramel malt scent. Poured black body with tan lace top, mostly lasting. The taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. The sweetness has more of a syrup than a toffee quality and the bitterness is just a hint in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, some stickiness in the texture, average carbonation and the light bitter finish. Not bad but with an overarching sense of artificiality. Not sure what it says about Jamaica! |
