Comments: Poured reddish brown thin lace top.  Aroma of sweet toffee malt and raisins. Similarly sweet in taste with not a lot more to say. But if you prefer dark beers and are in a Greek restaurant in Vienna,  you have no choice. Thin watery texture average carbonation and a lingering sweetness. @artcorner.
