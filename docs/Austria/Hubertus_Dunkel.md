Comments: '"Poured reddish brown thin lace top.  Aroma of sweet toffee malt and raisins.
  Similarly sweet in taste with not a lot more to say. But if you prefer dark beers
  and are in a Greek restaurant in Vienna,  you have no choice. Thin watery texture
  average carbonation and a lingering sweetness. @artcorner."'
