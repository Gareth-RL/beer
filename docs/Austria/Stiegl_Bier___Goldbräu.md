Comments: '"2016Tap. Aroma is oddly of cat pee. Pours golden with little head to speak
  of and correspondingly no lace. Full bodied with a refreshing crispness and pleasant
  nonspecific hoppy wash. Having missed the magnificent fine head, I seem to have
  also failed to notice the pleasant aftertaste unless no great languor is a new form
  of pleasantry so I would be lying if said I wanted more. 22/08/24 at the brewery
  itself it''s better presented.  No off putting aroma a decent foam lace top and
  a clean crisp lager taste. Not my preferred berr type but okay"'
