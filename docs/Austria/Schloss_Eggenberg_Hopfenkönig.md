Brewer: Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg

Comments: Bottle. Pours golden and clear with thin head. Aroma dry hops fruity. Taste
  light sweet medium bitter with light sour finish. Palate light to medium body, slick
  feel, average carbonation, no great finish but it lurks without purpose. Another
  beer that convinces me that Pilsner and lagers are not worth the effort.
