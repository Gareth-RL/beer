MyScore: 2.7
Comments: Poured a golden body with white foam top. Aroma of pale bread malts and straw hops. Lightly sweet with grassy hop and a sour mash finish. Medium bodied, mouth coating average carbonation, bitter/sour finish. Another supermarket special and it ticks another lager that I will not seek out again. Still on the beach in Bibione and there are lots of Austrians here. Maybe that's why it's here
