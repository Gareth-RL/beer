Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Engelszell Benno Trappistenbier
BeerID: 196688
Brewer: Stift Engelszell Trappistenbier-Brauerei
City: Engelhartszell an der Donau
Comments: Poured a light copper amber with an off white lace top. The aroma is predominantly
  malty but with yeast notes amidst the spiced bread and brown sugar. The taste is
  medium sweet even if it lacks the complexity that it claims. Some caramel malt and
  spiced fruit and a yeasty finish that possibly limits the bitterness. Palate is
  medium, smooth texture, fine carbonation and a slightly dusty finish that leaves
  a fuller mouth coating. I have tasted relatively few Austrian beers and embarrassingly
  few Belgian ones so this Trappist may well advise me to go home.
