| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured amber honey body with any lacing diminishing rapidly to a loose fizz. Aroma has the expected honey note amid some herbal grassy hops and bread malts. Taste is sweet with the honey accentuating the toffee malt but it does transition smoothly to a light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, average to above carbonation, and a light bitter. It's a bit gassy in my view. It confirms my preference for Bock over lager which is growing exponentially, but it is pleasant without ever threatening to be anything more. |
