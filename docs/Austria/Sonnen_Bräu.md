Comments: '"Poured pale gold body white loose foam that faded rapidly. Light hop and
  malt aroma: straw, grain, and paper scent. Taste is similarly light sweet to light
  sour with a bland climax. This is a beer that is determined to make no impression
  at all and it succeeds. Gassy, medium body I guess, and whatever feel wet cardboard
  has when swallowed. I drank this so you don''t have to...."'
