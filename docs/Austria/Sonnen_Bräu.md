| **Comments**  | Poured pale gold body white loose foam that faded rapidly. Light hop and malt aroma: straw, grain, and paper scent. Taste is similarly light sweet to light sour with a bland climax. This is a beer that is determined to make no impression at all and it succeeds. Gassy, medium body I guess, and whatever feel wet cardboard has when swallowed. I drank this so you don't have to....                                                                                      |
