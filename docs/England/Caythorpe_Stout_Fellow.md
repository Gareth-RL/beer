| **Comments** | Cask. Pours brown with thin tan foam top. Don’t be misled by the name, it’s a brown ale not a stout. Hence the relatively thin watery taste.but with some yeasty malts on the tongue and a fruity finish. Not outstanding by any means but might do better as a brown fellow rather than a stout one. |
