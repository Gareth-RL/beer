BeerID: 806660
Brewer: Exale Brewing
City: Walthamstow
Comments: Aroma has coffee malt. Poured cola black with no lacing to speak of. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter with coffee throughout. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel soft carbonation and a clammy finish. Not a stout I would return to but equally
  exactly what it claims to be.
