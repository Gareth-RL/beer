| **Comments** | Cask. A rich pineapple and mango scent. Pours pale gold with a white top which may confuse English IPA drinkers. The taste foregrounds the fruits with tangerine added to the tropical fruits but this is followed by a hoppy bitter finish with grassy lingering notes on the palate. So a well constructed American ale which is an easy way to imbibe 5.5% without noticing. So one for the weekend rather than midweek. |
