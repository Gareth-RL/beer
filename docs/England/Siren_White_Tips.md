Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Aroma is modestly grainy but none of the yeasty
  banana that some wheat beer drinkers love. Pours very pale yellow gold with white
  foam top. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium to light body, slick feel, average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Crisp and unremarkable.
