| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Aroma is modestly grainy but none of the yeasty banana that some wheat beer drinkers love. Pours very pale yellow gold with white foam top. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium to light body, slick feel, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Crisp and unremarkable. |
