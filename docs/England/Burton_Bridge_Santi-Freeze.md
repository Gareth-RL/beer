| **Comments** | So bad they brought it back. A seasonal ale that reflects the awful state of British Xmas beer. A very standard bitter with a different pump label and a dreadful pun. Anti-freeze would be a bolder choice. Aroma malts and hops. Pours golden with white top. Taste bitter. Palate medium to light with bitter biscuity edge. Overall cheap cash-in. |
