Brewer: Burton Bridge Brewery
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: So bad they brought it back. A seasonal ale that reflects the awful state
  of British Xmas beer. A very standard bitter with a different pump label and a dreadful
  pun. Anti-freeze would be a bolder choice. Aroma malts and hops. Pours golden with
  white top. Taste bitter. Palate medium to light with bitter biscuity edge. Overall
  cheap cash-in.
