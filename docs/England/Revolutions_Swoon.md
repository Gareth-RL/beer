| **Comments** | Cask. Pours black with brown tan top creamy head. Aroma is unmistakably cocoa. Buried below there is some vanilla and berry. Taste is strongly sweet with only a light bitter finish. Palate is creamy to start but thins to no more than medium. Flat carbonation. Sticky long finish and that could deter some. |
