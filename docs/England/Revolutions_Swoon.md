Beer: Revolutions Swoon
BeerID: 499093
Brewer: Revolutions Brewing (England)
City: Castleford
Comments: Cask. Pours black with brown tan top creamy head. Aroma is unmistakably
  cocoa. Buried below there is some vanilla and berry. Taste is strongly sweet with
  only a light bitter finish. Palate is creamy to start but thins to no more than
  medium. Flat carbonation. Sticky long finish and that could deter some.
