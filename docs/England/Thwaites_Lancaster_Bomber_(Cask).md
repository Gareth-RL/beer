| **Comments** | Not much sign of what is supposed to be a floral scent from Styrian Golding hops. Amber body with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a biscuit finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Unremarkable. Waste of a good pump clip which barely had Marston's visible.<br>Earlier Rating: 10/24/2015 Total Score: 3.7<br>Cask. Copper. Creamy head. Aroma of cereals and spruce. Nicely balanced with some wonderful malty caramel and sparkling hops. Medium bodied. Moderate lingering finish, considering the ease with which it goes down. Marstonâ€™s are keeping up Thwaites tradition of good session bitter. |
