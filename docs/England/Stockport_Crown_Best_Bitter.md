Brewer: Stockport Brewing Company
City: Stockport
Comments: Cask. Aroma grass, leaves, woody, with the barest hint of fruit. Pours copper
  with thin white lace top that sheets the glass. The taste is muted hop fruits and
  biscuit malt. A session bitter and pretty typical. An evening of this would require
  good conversation.
