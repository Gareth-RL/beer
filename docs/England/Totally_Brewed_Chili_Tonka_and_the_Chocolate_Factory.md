Comments: '"A pun that was waiting to happen. There''s a warning chili in the scent
  and it will return in the finish but there''s chocolate too for sure. Poured black
  bodied with tan broken lacing. Taste is medium sweet to spicy. This does rather
  squeeze the space for Tonka beans but they stick around. Palate is medium bodied
  clammy feel soft to average carbonation and the chili heated finish. It''s not jalapeno
  style but one cannot distinguish this from alcohol burn so in future it could mask
  a move up to imperial octane levels."'
