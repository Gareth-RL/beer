| **Comments** | A pun that was waiting to happen. There's a warning chili in the scent and it will return in the finish but there's chocolate too for sure. Poured black bodied with tan broken lacing. Taste is medium sweet to spicy. This does rather squeeze the space for Tonka beans but they stick around. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and the chili heated finish. It's not jalapeno style but one cannot distinguish this from alcohol burn so in future it could mask a move up to imperial octane levels. |
