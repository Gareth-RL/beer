BeerID: 464513
Brewer: Mad Hatter Brewing Co.
City: Liverpool
Comments: Tap. Pours black with tan lace top. Aroma is malty with coconut and vanilla
  and coffee. The taste is sweet with soft fruits to the fore. I was expecting more
  coconut or chocolate to emerge in the taste. And it was a bit gassy on the palate
  in the finish. Still an interesting experiment.
