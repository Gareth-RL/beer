| **Comments** | Can. Poured poorly 2/3rd foam in a tilted glass with a slow pour. Chocolate malt aroma. Taste is medium sweet to bitter, rapid transition so it's the latter that persists. Palate was thin to medium bodied, smooth, but over-carbonated, with a hint of coffee in the bitter finish. If one obtains a glass of beer rather than foam, it's decent enough |
