Comments: '"Can. Poured poorly 2/3rd foam in a tilted glass with a slow pour. Chocolate
  malt aroma. Taste is medium sweet to bitter, rapid transition so it''s the latter
  that persists. Palate was thin to medium bodied, smooth, but over-carbonated, with
  a hint of coffee in the bitter finish. If one obtains a glass of beer rather than
  foam, it''s decent enough"'
