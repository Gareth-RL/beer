| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange with white lace top. Aroma has peach and berry fruits and toffee malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and bitter finish. This is my second NE IPA today that seems to want to amplify the malt, but keep the hops tropical or citric. Not an easy choice and while this is decent, other combinations work better. |
