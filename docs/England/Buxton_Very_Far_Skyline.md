Comments: '"Tap at the Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours golden body thin halo of mostly
  lasting lacing. Aroma has the white grape and dry hops. Taste is medium sour. Palate
  is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a sour bitter finish. It
  is what it is, and that is a Berliner that is too sour for this drinker&#39;s unsophisticated
  palate."'
