| **Comments** | Cask. Lightly spiced although this is more in the taste than the scent. Aroma softly fruity. Pours copper bubbly top. Broken lacing. Taste has allspice in there for the Christmas season but otherwise smoothly balanced malt biscuit and hop fruits. The fruit lingers. Not bad but surely the repentant Marley deserves better if Scrooge did? |
