| **Comments** | Poured dark cola brown with tan cream lace. Aroma has chocolate roasted slightly smoky malts. Taste is medium sweet with coffee initially and light licorice in the finish. Smooth texture, medium bodied average carbonation, and a slightly mineral finish. A highly drinkable porter with good complexity for the abv. Will the old woman with chicken legs be placed in a barrel for an aged imperial version I wonder? |
