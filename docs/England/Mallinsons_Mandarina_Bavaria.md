Beer: Mallinsons Mandarina Bavaria
BeerID: 582012
Brewer: Mallinsons Brewing Co.
City: Huddersfield
Comments: The hop does its job with tart orange aroma. Pours pale yellow gold with
  white loose lace.  Taste is medium bitter with a light background sweetness. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a sharp bitter finish.
  I have still to find a single hop beer that stands out for me.
