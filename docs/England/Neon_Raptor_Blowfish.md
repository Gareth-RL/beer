| **Comments** | Tap @ The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours a murky orange with off white froth top. Aroma is amply floral hops. Taste is medium bitter with light sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth pale malt texture, and sour notes in a long finish. I&#39;m in training for Boston trip so NEIPA is essential. |
