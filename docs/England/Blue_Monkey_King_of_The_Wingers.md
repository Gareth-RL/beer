| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours chestnut off white lace top. Aroma has bread, floral, herbal hop notes. Taste is medium bitter with sweet hop berry background and a bitter biscuit finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter, crumbly biscuit finish. A very decent session bitter. |
