| **Comments** | Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours rich black brown body and full creamy tan head, a model stout in looks. Aroma is predictably malty with some licorice and charcoal notes. Taste is largely unvarying bitterness with perhaps a hint of berry in the fore and ash in the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky rather than creamy, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. So flawed in terms of smoothness in the swallow. Nonetheless it&#39;s far better than I expected considering how many full thin stouts there are. Towcester is giving Dublin a run for their money. |
