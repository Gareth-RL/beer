Beer: Nottingham 40th Festivale XL
BeerID: 367029
Brewer: Nottingham Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Chestnut brown creamy top. Light biscuit aroma but nothing much. Some
  fruit in the taste. Dates. Prunes but again not strongly so. Watery and lacks body.
  Some residual bitterness and carbonation. It doesn’t do the Nottingham beer festival
  any favours nor the brewery much credit. They can do first rate beers across the
  range from stout to pale so why something this undistinguished.
