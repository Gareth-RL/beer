| **Comments** | Cask. New to the Organ Grinder list. Simply referred to as very dark on the pump. Pours black with tan cream head. Not much in the aroma save mixed roasted malts The coffee is there in the taste but not dramatically. Lacks the body or texture of a stout, unlike the Guerrilla so I would class it as Porter or strong Mild. Smooth enough with a slight bitter kick like coffee grounds in the end. |
