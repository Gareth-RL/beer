| **Comments** | Cask at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours a pleasing ruby chestnut brown with scummy tan lacing. Aroma is plum and herbal notes that will be indefinable for anyone who has never tasted dandelion & burdock. Before Brits got coke, d&b was the substitute. Whether it enhances beer is debatable &#40;I wouldn&#39;t smile if someone added coke either&#41;. Taste here is medium sweet to lightly bitter but with a residual quality that some may disparage. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and the aforementioned uncertain ending. If this ever takes the world by storm, it will be a different world. So maybe a Star Wars tie-in needed. For me it&#39;s nostalgia but for others it&#39;s an oddity. |
