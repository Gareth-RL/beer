Brewer: Full Mash Brewery

Comments: Cask. Poured golden body white lace top. Aroma grassy herbal hops. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter but with a musty transition that sours things. Palate
  is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish.  Okay
  but that may be a compliment.
