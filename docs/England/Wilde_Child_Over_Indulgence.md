| **Comments** | Vanilla lactose and caramel malts. Poured murky brown with tan lace top. Taste is medium to full sweetness with light bitter finish. Certainly the ice-cream effect is most evident in the taste. Palate is no more than medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish that never quite escapes the lactose sweetness.  Fine if you have a sweet tooth. |
