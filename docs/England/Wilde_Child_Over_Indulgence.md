Beer: Wilde Child Over Indulgence
BeerID: 798502
Brewer: Wilde Child Brewing Co
City: Leeds
Comments: Vanilla lactose and caramel malts. Poured murky brown with tan lace top.
  Taste is medium to full sweetness with light bitter finish. Certainly the ice-cream
  effect is most evident in the taste. Palate is no more than medium bodied clammy
  feel soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish that never quite escapes
  the lactose sweetness.  Fine if you have a sweet tooth.
