Comments: '"Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours dark brown almost black body
  with tan broken cream top. Aroma has definite dark chocolate cocoa scent with dark
  roasted malts singing backup and some creamy notes as well. Taste is richly sweet
  to bitter with the chocolate theme dominant. If the palate had been heavier its
  porter status would have been in jeopardy but it is barely medium, smooth rich feel,
  soft to average carbonation, and a crisp bitter finish. What I don&#39;t get personally
  is any coconut which to my mind would push the sweetness too far. But clearly the
  brewer expected it to be here "'
