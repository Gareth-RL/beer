| **Comments** | Pours slightly hazy golden body with thin off-white lace top. Definite aroma of nectarine, pineapple with a hint of passion fruit. Taste is medium sweet with juicy fruits to the fore, and a light bitter finish with some biscuit. Palate is medium bodied, slightly mineral texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. A pleasant IPA which was ideal for a laid-back birthday on a rainy August evening. |
