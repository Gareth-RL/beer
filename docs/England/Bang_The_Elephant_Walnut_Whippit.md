Overall: 14.0
MyScore: 3.5
Comments: Poured dark brown body thin tan lace top. Aroma milky chocolate caramel and nut (as expected). Like its inspiration it's sweet with more sugar than nut flavours but in an age of pastry stout, it's not out of place. Thin, watery texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish struggling through the sweetness.
