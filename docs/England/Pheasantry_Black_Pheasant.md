Beer: Pheasantry Black Pheasant
BeerID: 655907
Brewer: Pheasantry Brewery
City: Newark
Comments: Aroma has roasted malts with coffee notes. Poured chestnut with ruby light
  and a thin off white lace top. Taste is light to medium sweet to medium bitter with
  a long finish. Palate is medium to light bodied so thin for porter, texture is sticky
  but granular, average carbonation and a long bitter finish. I kept missing it so
  when I got it I was disappointed (that can apply to lots of things).
