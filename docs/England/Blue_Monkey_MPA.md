Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Blue Monkey MPA
BeerID: 738964
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has pale malts and grassy lightly citrus hops. Pours clear golden
  body with white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average to fizzy carbonation and a long finish. Overall a bit of a puzzle
  since it appeared on the taps with a small array of foreign lagers. BM are cask
  producers in the main and this would be a summer blonde in  their strong regular
  list.
