| **Comments** | An oatmeal stout with plenty of coffee in the scent. Dark mahogany body with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet but with a growing bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. It grew on me even if I thought it was spelt Monkies. Or is that the Pop group? |
