Beer: Downlands Does Contain Nuts
BeerID: 732840
Brewer: Downlands Brewery
City: Small Dole
Comments: Bready roasted malt aroma. Dark chestnut body and lasting tan lacing. Taste
  is medium sweet to lightly bitter with lots of flavours that I would associate with
  a winter or autumn ale. Yet here we are in spring. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. Not very familiar with the Belgian
  beers so hesitate to say more.
