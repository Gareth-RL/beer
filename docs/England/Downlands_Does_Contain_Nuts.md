| **Comments** | Bready roasted malt aroma. Dark chestnut body and lasting tan lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with lots of flavours that I would associate with a winter or autumn ale. Yet here we are in spring. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. Not very familiar with the Belgian beers so hesitate to say more. |
