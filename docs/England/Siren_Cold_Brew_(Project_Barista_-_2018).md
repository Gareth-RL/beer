BeerID: 619651
Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark brown body with thin tan bubbly lace. Aroma has some
  coffee and a little fudge although for me the latter was more in the mouth than
  on the nose. Taste is medium bitter with some sweet and sourness swirling either
  side. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation and a
  light coffee bitter finish. Insofar as it made me forget it was a lager, it was
  a triumph.
