| **Comments** | Tap @Junkyard Nottingham. Pours pale yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma has tangerine pith and light floral notes. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, light sour finish. The repetition of the word &#39;fair&#39; sums it up. |
