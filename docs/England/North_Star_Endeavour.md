Comments: Cask. A.n interesting malt aroma with aniseed and pepper notes. Pours very
  dark almost black body and tan cream top. A taste that combines some soft fruits
  sweetness with roasted malts and licorice and quite a bitter languor. Thus fuller
  on the palate and the slightly acrid edge may deter some.
