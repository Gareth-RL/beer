| **Comments** | Barrel pour at the Barrel Drop. Aroma is muted and modest but I detect sweet malts and hops. Pours amber gold with bubbly top that faded fast. In taste the malts have it in a shy biscuity kind of way. Not much of the citrus hops except at the back of the palate of a light floral ale. Unremarkable is too long a word for it. |
