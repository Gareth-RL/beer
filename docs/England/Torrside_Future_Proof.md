BeerID: 364573
Brewer: Torrside Brewing
City: New Mills
Comments: Barrel pour at the Barrel Drop. Aroma is muted and modest but I detect sweet
  malts and hops. Pours amber gold with bubbly top that faded fast. In taste the malts
  have it in a shy biscuity kind of way. Not much of the citrus hops except at the
  back of the palate of a light floral ale. Unremarkable is too long a word for it.
