| **Comments** | Cask at the Falcon. The liveliest Halloween pub&#40;but barely a dozen souls&#41; . Aroma has toast, grass, resin, notes. It pours golden with white top. Like all Oakham ale hoppy. Slightly spicy on the tongue but predominantly sweet to bitter with the spicy twist  palate no more than medium, slick feel, soft carbonation  spicy finish. I suspect that the Citra sells better. Bring on the 4 warlocks. |
