| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy golden orange with white lace top. Aroma is mango and pineapple hops although the lactose is there too. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Not much bitterness in this pale. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall a pleasantly fruity IPA. |
