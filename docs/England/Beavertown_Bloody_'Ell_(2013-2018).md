| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught. Pours golden yellow with white foam top. Aroma is pale malts and citric hops. Taste is juicy sweet to bitter in the medium range. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to soft carbonation, bitter finish. Maybe I will take my blood oranges this way in future. |
