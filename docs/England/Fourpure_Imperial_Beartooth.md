| **Comments** | Aroma is malty but only mutedly caramel; I detected more grainy roast and light coffee. Poured a rich brown chestnut with thin tan lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with an arrowroot tang. I guess there is also some hop fruit in there. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture,  average carbonation, and a long bitter finish. I have noticed that carbonation seems stronger in the cans. Overall, I wonder at the concept of the Imperial Brown Ale (even if we all nod and say genres are arbitrary). For me this is a strong brown ale but I am not convinced that it has moved up in character the way one assumes a Stout or IPA does when it goes imperial; all of which is a roundabout way of saying that I don't think an Imperial should be quite so average somehow. |
