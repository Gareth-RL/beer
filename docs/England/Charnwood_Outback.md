| **Comments** | Bottle at home. Poured a pale yellow gold with diminishing white lacing. Aroma certainly delivers apricot and peaches although there was an initial hint of lemon as well. Nevertheless scent and looks are above average in my view. Taste is medium sweet initially as the same fruit notes prevail, but it transits to a medium bitterness that pleasant enough. Palate is the only deficiency in my view since the medium body yields some mineral clamminess that also adds a slight chalky quality to the bitter finish. Carbonation is average. A couple of years back I had started to resent the proliferation of golden ales which struck me as a backwash from the soaring demand for pale ale and the plughole downward spiral of demand for bitter among the discerning drinkers. Now I am reconciled, and if they were all of this quality it would be no problem. |
