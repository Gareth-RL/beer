| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark mahogany with a ruby glint. Aroma has chocolate biscuit and a hint of coffee. All good. Smokey - a little. Smooth - agreed. Full-bodied only if you are gymnastic. In short it does a lot of things well but it fails to impress profoundly enough to meet the question if a 5% stout or the Liffey black was there would you bother? |
