Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 8.0
Beer: Magpie Raven Stout
BeerID: 171005
Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pours dark mahogany with a ruby glint. Aroma has chocolate biscuit
  and a hint of coffee. All good. Smokey - a little. Smooth - agreed. Full-bodied
  only if you are gymnastic. In short it does a lot of things well but it fails to
  impress profoundly enough to meet the question if a 5% stout or the Liffey black
  was there would you bother?
