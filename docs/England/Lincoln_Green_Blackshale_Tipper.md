| **Comments** | Tap at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours clear amber with white lace top. Aroma has resinous toffee malt with herbal hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture soft carbonation and a long finish. Fuller flavoured on the malt side but eccentric in a pale scene dominated by tropical citric hops. |
