Comments: Poured rich gold body thin lace top.  Aroma of  light malts. Medium sweet to bitter with what's known in the trade as balanced but you may encounter as bland. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  A blonde that tasted like a bitter to me. Ampersand can stand for etc.
