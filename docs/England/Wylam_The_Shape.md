| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours a murky orange brown with thin white lace top. Aroma has a citrus herbal floral witches brew. Taste is briefly sweet then lightly sour but with some bitter languor. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a finish as murky as the colour. Overall curiously and paradoxically shapeless. |
