Comments: '"Tap at the Crafty Crow. Listed as Triple IPA but it&#39;s not an Imperial
  in taste. Pours murky orange with scummy thin top once foam dies back. Aroma Simcoe
  and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet with a bit of alcohol burn at the back. Palate
  also medium, slick texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. My guess is that
  it is an experiment that needs more lab time. If it is a Tripel the monks won&#39;t
  be happy. 13/05/18 A second tasting. Still very cloudy orange with white lace top.
  Aroma citric and peachy. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some souring alcohol
  heat. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and the heat I mentioned.
  So it still needs tuning in my opinion."'
