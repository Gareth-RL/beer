| **Comments** | Tap at Yarn, Castle Rock bar at the Theatre Royal. Pours lightly hazy yellow with thin halo of fading lace. Aroma is lemon pickle. Taste is lightly bitter medium sour. But not as vinegary as this sounds, thank goodness. Palate is medium bodied at most sticky, average carbonation, astringent finish and a slight numbing of the tongue. Maybe that explains the Moroccan cuisine recommendation &#40;a tad unfair&#41;. |
