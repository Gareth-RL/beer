Comments: 'Emphatic in flavour and scent. Pistachio and vanilla dominate the aroma.
  Poured brown body tan lace top. Sweet as you would expect but the flavour essences
  are relentless. It could have been subtler. Thin to medium bodied watery texture
  average carbonation and -would you believe it--a nutty finish '
