| **Comments** | Tap at The Neon Raptor taproom Nottingham. Pours clear golden the first of theirs that has been clear&#41;. Aroma is citrus, tropical fruit and herb spicy hops as the recipe suggests. Taste is medium sweet with sour notes in the transition to a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, texture is somewhere between oily and sticky without being either exactly, average carbonation and a subtle bitter finish. It grew on me. |
