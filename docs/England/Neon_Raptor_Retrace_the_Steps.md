Comments: '"Tap at The Neon Raptor taproom Nottingham. Pours clear golden the first
  of theirs that has been clear&#41;. Aroma is citrus, tropical fruit and herb spicy
  hops as the recipe suggests. Taste is medium sweet with sour notes in the transition
  to a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, texture is somewhere between oily and
  sticky without being either exactly, average carbonation and a subtle bitter finish.
  It grew on me."'
