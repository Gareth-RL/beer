| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow orange gold in the NE style. Aroma has peach and muted citrus. Taste is medium bitter. Palate reflects the oats addition. Medium bodied but slightly creamy texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Overall I think Almasty are my standout N-E brewer, although it is a long way from Newcastle to New England. |
