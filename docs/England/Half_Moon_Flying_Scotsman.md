| **Comments** | Poured copper body with full foam lace top. Aroma of lightly roasted malts and floral hops. Medium to light both sweet and bitter with a balanced transition. Malt bread notes predominate. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation (for bottled ale) and a bitter finish. There's nowt 'rong with it, as they might say in Yorkshire. Comes over a session bitter with an amber look, but if Red or international brings in the trade, good luck to them. Purchased at the National Railway Museum, York. |
