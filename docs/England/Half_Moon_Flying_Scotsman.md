Comments: '"Poured copper body with full foam lace top. Aroma of lightly roasted malts
  and floral hops. Medium to light both sweet and bitter with a balanced transition.
  Malt bread notes predominate. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation
  (for bottled ale) and a bitter finish. There''s nowt ''rong with it, as they might
  say in Yorkshire. Comes over a session bitter with an amber look, but if Red or
  international brings in the trade, good luck to them. Purchased at the National
  Railway Museum, York."'
