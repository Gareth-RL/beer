Comments: Cask at The Organ Grinder Nottingham. Pours clear golden brown with white
  lace top. Aroma is pale malts and hop fruits - nothing special. Taste is medium
  bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation and a long bitter
  finish. Not sure what if anything dry hopping added to this pale ale.
