| **Comments** | Poured ruby amber body tan cream lace. Aroma caramelised malts. Medium sweet to lightly bitter  but the sweet malts predominate. The finish is a slight sour tang. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light souring finish. It doesn't taste like the Dunkel I have had but equally it doesn't taste like the lagers I don't like. |
