Comments: '"Poured ruby amber body tan cream lace. Aroma caramelised malts. Medium
  sweet to lightly bitter  but the sweet malts predominate. The finish is a slight
  sour tang. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light souring
  finish. It doesn''t taste like the Dunkel I have had but equally it doesn''t taste
  like the lagers I don''t like."'
