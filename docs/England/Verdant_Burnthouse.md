Beer: Verdant Burnthouse
BeerID: 1062647
Brewer: Verdant Brewing Co
City: Kernick
Comments: It tastes better than it looks or smells but that may be down to the cellar
  man. Poured black body thin lace diminishing rapidly to a swirl. Aroma of dark roasted
  malt. Medium sweet to bitter with coffee cocoa and a tang of ash for good measure.
  Medium bodied soft to average carbonation smooth texture and a bitter finish. Decent
  enough.
