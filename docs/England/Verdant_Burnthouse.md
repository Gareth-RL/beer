| **Comments** | It tastes better than it looks or smells but that may be down to the cellar man. Poured black body thin lace diminishing rapidly to a swirl. Aroma of dark roasted malt. Medium sweet to bitter with coffee cocoa and a tang of ash for good measure. Medium bodied soft to average carbonation smooth texture and a bitter finish. Decent enough. |
