Comments: '"Mango peach pineapple. Fruity in anyone''s alphabet. Murky  orange golden
  body thin film. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with juice throughout. A
  tad thin and watery in the mouth, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A cask ale
  saluting a craft style. It suffers by comparison."'
