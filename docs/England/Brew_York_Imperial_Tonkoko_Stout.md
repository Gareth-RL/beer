Beer: Brew York Imperial Tonkoko Stout
BeerID: 554664
Brewer: Brew York
City: York
Comments: Aroma has lots of Tonka which mirrors vanilla and coconut. Pours dark brown
  almost black with tan halo. Taste is medium bitter with a background sweetness.
  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long complex flavoursome
  finish. A haiku of a finish. Anything more would be too much.
