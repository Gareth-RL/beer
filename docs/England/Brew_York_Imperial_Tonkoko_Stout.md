| **Comments** | Aroma has lots of Tonka which mirrors vanilla and coconut. Pours dark brown almost black with tan halo. Taste is medium bitter with a background sweetness. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long complex flavoursome finish. A haiku of a finish. Anything more would be too much. |
