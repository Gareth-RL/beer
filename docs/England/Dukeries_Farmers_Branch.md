| **Comments** | Cask guest ale at the Hand and Heart. Predictably citrus on the nose and hops on the tongue. Golden with uneven spotted lace top. Sharp and refreshing as promised. And 5% abv. A beer for a languid summer. For any young man teetering on the brink from lager to real ale this may be a gateway. And then you can grow up. |
