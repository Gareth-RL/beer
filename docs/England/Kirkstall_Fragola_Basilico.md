Comments: 'Strawberry basil and pepper sour. And the basil and strawberries are in
  the scent. The pepper in the palate. Pours hazy reddish orange with broken lacing.
  Taste is fruity with just enough savour to freshen. Palate is light to medium bodied
  oily texture soft carbonation and a spicy light finish '
