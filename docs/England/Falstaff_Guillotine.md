| **Comments** | Cask at the Hand and Heart. Pours golden with thin lace top. Aroma has pale malts and herbal hops. Taste is light to medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied with oily texture, average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall utterly unremarkable. The only thing of note was at least three different spellings of guillotine. |
