Comments: Aroma is dominated by the Bourbon with toffee malts below. Pours dark brown
  with tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter dates and soft sugars evident.
  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation with a warm finish. A pleasant
  winter warmer for the mildest February in my memory.
