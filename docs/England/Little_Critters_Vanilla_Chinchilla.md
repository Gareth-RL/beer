| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of vanilla and chocolate malts. Sweet with lactose vanilla and milk chocolate notes. A malty milkshake with just a nod of hop in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. You get what you expect and that's fine by me |
