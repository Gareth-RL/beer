| **Comments** | Tap. Pours dark black brown with cream tan top. Aroma dark malts cereal, licorice, coffee, resin, but all muted rather than pungent. Taste is medium to full sweetness and a bitterness back beat. Palate is odd, creamy texture but beneath the coating there&#39;s nothing beyond medium in body, carbonation soft to flat, and thus the finish is long but more due to the coating tongue effect than a  languorous expansion of flavour. Less than the sum of its parts. |
