Comments: '"Yr Brewed to commemorate the bicentenary of the Pentrich revolution with
  members of the Amber Valley CAMRA. Described as brown stout from 1800&#39;s recipe.
  Is that traditional enough? Aroma has caramel, roasty, malts herbs, resin, dough,
  soy sauce, a lot to unpack. Pours dark amber brown with ruby lights and tan cream
  top. Taste is light sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour, salty, with a definite
  alcohol note in there: You know this is 6.2% cask ale. Palate is medium body, thick
  feel, soft carbonation, bitter in the finish. So an enigma wrapped inside a dilemma
  but definitely a new LG beer."'
