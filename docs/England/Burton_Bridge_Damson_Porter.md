| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is true to the name with damson scents atop a background of malt and bread. Pours a handsome reddish mahogany with a creamy tan top that laces well. While there is fruit in the taste (unsurprisingly) this mellows quickly so that other sour salty flavours can be had. Overall I felt this was a good example of the fruit porter style, although maybe not top of the league. |
