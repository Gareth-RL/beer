| **Comments** | Tap. I had this directly after Highwire to see how the Mosaic affected the recipe. So aroma muted lemon and melon. Pours cloudy amber orange with thin top and broken lacing. So the main effect of Mosaic is to muffle all the flavours that stood out in the original. Of course if this were the first High wire you tried you might prefer the melon finish to the pineapples bonanza. But I was deflated slightly  |
