Comments: 'Tap. I had this directly after Highwire to see how the Mosaic affected
  the recipe. So aroma muted lemon and melon. Pours cloudy amber orange with thin
  top and broken lacing. So the main effect of Mosaic is to muffle all the flavours
  that stood out in the original. Of course if this were the first High wire you tried
  you might prefer the melon finish to the pineapples bonanza. But I was deflated
  slightly '
