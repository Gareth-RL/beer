| **Comments** | Cask. Spicy hops predominate in a pleasant aroma. Colour honey gold and paler in the light. I guess the pale malts and extra hops tell in the end. Taste well it fills and coats with a metallic edge to the first sip and good resinous palate. Better than many. And deceptively strong. I would try again if offered. |
