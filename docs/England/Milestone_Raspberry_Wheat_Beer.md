| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of soured fruit. Pours amber gold on the orange band. Has a spotted thin white head with little lacing. I assumed a wheat beer would be light and refreshing on a sultry day. But a pale would have been the better choice. Tastes of biscuits soaked in lychee juice and not in a good way. I canâ€™t say the raspberries came through for me, but that is not a disappointment, but the rest is. 07/06/2024, giving it a second chance.  Clears to pale amber full white lace top.  Aroma fruit extract and grains. Taste is full sweet thanks to the infusion, and I detect raspberry and this fades to the finish.  Still heavy for a wheat beer and still sticky biscuit texture but not as offensive as first time. Don't assume witbier is like this. |
