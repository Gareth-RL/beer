| **Comments** | Poured dark brown amber body with murky lacing. Aroma is hoppy rather than malty Simcoe and Centennial evident. Taste is medium sour heading to bitter with grapefruit pith playing it's part. Palate is light to medium bodied average carbonation drying mouth feel. Overall like no brown ale I ever had before! |
