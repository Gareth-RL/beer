| **Comments** | Poured black lace halo. Aroma is indeed maple syrup chocolate and a hint of pecan but not over the top, believe it or not. Taste has more chocolate and coffee but the sweetness is a foil for a bitter coffee finish. Palate is medium bodied soft and smooth texture. Soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it's a pastry stout that doesn't make it impossible to imagine drinking anything else. A session Imperial! |
