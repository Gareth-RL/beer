Comments: '"Poured black lace halo. Aroma is indeed maple syrup chocolate and a hint
  of pecan but not over the top, believe it or not. Taste has more chocolate and coffee
  but the sweetness is a foil for a bitter coffee finish. Palate is medium bodied
  soft and smooth texture. Soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it''s a pastry
  stout that doesn''t make it impossible to imagine drinking anything else. A session
  Imperial!"'
