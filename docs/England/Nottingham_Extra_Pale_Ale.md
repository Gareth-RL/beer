Comments: 'Aroma pleasant and slightly nutty. Appearance Golden with thin head but
  strong lacing. Taste tang of mown grass not my usual preference but ideal when the
  sun beats. Palate strong initially with bitter ripples. Slightly acidic aftertaste.
  This could wear on you over a session but it could equally provide a foil for a
  malty brew. 18/02/20 second sipping. Still dry and bitter. '
