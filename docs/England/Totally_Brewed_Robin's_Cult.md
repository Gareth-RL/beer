| **Comments** | Pale malt and herbal grassy hop detected. Robin's cult is not an olfactory one. Pours yellow gold with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet and lightly bitter with maybe a light sour note. No umami. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light finish. When things gravitate to the bland, your cult does not have a medium but is mediocre. |
