Comments: '"Pale malt and herbal grassy hop detected. Robin''s cult is not an olfactory
  one. Pours yellow gold with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet and lightly bitter
  with maybe a light sour note. No umami. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average
  carbonation and a light finish. When things gravitate to the bland, your cult does
  not have a medium but is mediocre."'
