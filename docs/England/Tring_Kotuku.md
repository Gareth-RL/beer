| **Comments** | The sun is shining and that is right for paler golden ales. This one has a gentle grassy scent. A good golden yellow colour in the body and a thin film top. The kindest way to describe the taste is balanced and understated. The hops are certainly there but as it washes the palate the sharpness is subdued by a malty coating. This gives it some persistence on the palate. Overall perfectly okay as a session ale in a beer garden on a sunny evening. But not one to jump at. |
