| **Comments** | Aroma has herbal hop and bread malts. Pours dark cooper body and off white top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a preponderance of dark fruit sweetness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long vague ultimately bitter finish. If I were a long-eared owl, I would be vaguely insulted. Interesting bird deserves interesting beer. But I'm not. So what I feel is disappointed and some bloating and both indicate that this review should end. |
