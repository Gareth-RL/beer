Comments: '"Aroma has herbal hop and bread malts. Pours dark cooper body and off white
  top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a preponderance of dark fruit
  sweetness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long vague
  ultimately bitter finish. If I were a long-eared owl, I would be vaguely insulted.
  Interesting bird deserves interesting beer. But I''m not. So what I feel is disappointed
  and some bloating and both indicate that this review should end."'
