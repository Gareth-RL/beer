BeerID: 425468
Brewer: Welbeck Abbey Brewery
City: Welbeck
Comments: Poured clear golden body white lace top.  Not much scent, maybe light floral
  hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with definite ginger infusion but it adds life to
  a pretty listless pale. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a spicy
  finish.  Tom can keep it.
