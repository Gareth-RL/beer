Comments: 'Aroma has grassy hop and pale malt. Pours clear and very pale gold with
  thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with grapefruit pith to accentuate the
  latter. Palate is thin to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. Decent but too bitter in the finish for me '
