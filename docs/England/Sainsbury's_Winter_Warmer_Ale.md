| **Comments** | Bottle. Impulse buy at Sainsbury's. Not sure if Seasonal edition implies that the recipe for this Winter Ale changes come the spring. Certainly there's a hint of clove or some other spice on the nose amid the dark roasted malts. Poured chestnut body with thin off white lace diminishing. Taste is medium sweet with smooth toffee notes. Spicy finish. Thin to medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a sliced bitter finish. Decent enough  |
