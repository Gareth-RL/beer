Comments: '"Tap at The Kean&#39;s Head. Pours brown amber body with foamy lace top
  mostly lasting. Aroma has toffee malt and yeast notes. Taste is medium to full sweet
  to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation,
  and a long finish. Belgian enough for me, but that may not mean much to the connoisseurs
  out there."'
