| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden pale straw. White top and lasting lacing. Aroma cheesy yeast. But it is the taste that most disappoints. Medium sour. Medium bitter with some saltiness. Body light to medium. Texture sticky. Carbonation soft. Finish soft and long due to oil on the palate. A beer that fails and refuses to leave. 04/07/18 it has not improved nor gone away. Remarkable in a way. A bad way. |
