| **Comments** | Can. Aroma tropical fruits tangerine and straw. Pours orange gold with thin white top diminishing rapidly. I suspect it may be a beer that tastes better on tap. Here it has a good malty fruit balance but the carbonation seems to muffle the taste in terms of the individual characteristics. For a craft ale that will feature more in this form than any other itâ€™s a commercial challenge. That said it has scored at or above my average for an IPA. |
