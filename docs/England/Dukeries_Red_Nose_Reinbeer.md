Beer: Dukeries Red Nose Reinbeer
BeerID: 473084
Brewer: Dukeries Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: Cask. No real scent just floral hops. Pours pale gold with lasting white
  top. Tasted is a muted bitterness with soft fruits and since I quite like Dukeries
  beer it’s a double disappointment. The festive ale curse strikes again.
