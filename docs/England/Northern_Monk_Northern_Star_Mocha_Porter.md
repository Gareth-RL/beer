| **Comments** | Can. Pours dark almost black tan circle top. Aroma is malty with coffee chocolate notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, texture oily rather than creamy, carbonation average, and the finish is bitter. Certainly this should not offend those who dislike coffee porter due to over sweetness. I suspect it is better on tap than in the can. |
