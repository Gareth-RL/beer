Comments: Tap. Aroma licorice and coffee. Pours like a black coffee with a faint and
  fading tan top. Taste has sweet chocolate coffee and licorice notes and a hint of
  spice. Carbonation lengthened the savour but the finish on the palate is soft. Plenty
  to enjoy in terms of flavour but needs more texture since the creamy side muddied
  rather than enriched.
