| **Comments** | Tap at The Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours dark body thin lace top. Aroma has roasted malts coffee toffee notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, creamy, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall not the coconut I expected till the last moment of each sip. |
