Beer: Bang The Elephant / Abstract Jungle Abstract Elephant
BeerID: 772950
Brewer: Bang The Elephant Brewing
City: Langley Mill
Comments: Pours chestnut brown with ruby tint and tan lace top. Aroma has a herbal
  vegetable hop note with roasted malts. Taste is a striking blend of bitter and sweet
  with even a spice note. But mainly bitter. Smooth with light to medium body average
  carbonation and a long bitter finish. I have to say that this is a brewery to watch
  as they produce different stuff rather than standard fare. (I am not a brown ale
  man, for instance, but this made me think).
