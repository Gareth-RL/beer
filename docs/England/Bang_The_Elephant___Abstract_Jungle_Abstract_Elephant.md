| **Comments** | Pours chestnut brown with ruby tint and tan lace top. Aroma has a herbal vegetable hop note with roasted malts. Taste is a striking blend of bitter and sweet with even a spice note. But mainly bitter. Smooth with light to medium body average carbonation and a long bitter finish. I have to say that this is a brewery to watch as they produce different stuff rather than standard fare. (I am not a brown ale man, for instance, but this made me think). |
