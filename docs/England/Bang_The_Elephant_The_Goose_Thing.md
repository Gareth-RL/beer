| **Comments** | Can. Pours hazy golden body with full white foam head. Aroma has some tropical fruit notes and a yeasty back note. Taste is medium sweet with a souring bitter finish. Palate is medium with a grainy texture average carbonation and sourdough finish. Still undecided about the merits of white/black IPAs but whatever this is, it tastes fine. |
