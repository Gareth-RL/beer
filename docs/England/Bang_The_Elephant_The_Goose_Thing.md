Beer: Bang The Elephant The Goose Thing
BeerID: 867324
Brewer: Bang The Elephant Brewing
City: Langley Mill
Comments: Can. Pours hazy golden body with full white foam head. Aroma has some tropical
  fruit notes and a yeasty back note. Taste is medium sweet with a souring bitter
  finish. Palate is medium with a grainy texture average carbonation and sourdough
  finish. Still undecided about the merits of white/black IPAs but whatever this is,
  it tastes fine.
