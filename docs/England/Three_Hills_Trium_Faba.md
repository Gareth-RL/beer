| **Comments** | Poured dark brown almost black with tan lace. Aroma of roasted malt coffee chocolate vanilla and tonka. Taste is full sweet to lightly nutty. Vanilla marshmallow and tonka spiciness. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation the spicy finish disguises the alcohol heat. A very decent imperial |
