| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma lightly floral and hoppy. Pours golden wit thick white top, sheet lacing. Taste is crisp and slightly grassy with citrus and melon un the background. Coats the palate with some residual bitterness but no great body: light to medium. For me a beer that appeals less with each mouthful and that canâ€™t be a good thing. 23/06/23 second sipping still not my thing  |
