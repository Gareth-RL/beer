| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours dark brown with ample creamy foam head. Aroma is impressive with a definite dark chocolate biscuit scent, behind which hop fruits glitter beguilingly. Taste is medium to light sweet and then a medium bitterness. Palate is no more than medium bodied with less creaminess than I anticipated but still smooth. Overall a  beer that made me want to try more Baltic Porter. |
