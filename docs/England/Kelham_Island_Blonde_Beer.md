Brewer: Kelham Island Brewery
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask. Aroma of apricot and pine. Pours pale amber with strong lace top.
  Tastes of citrus but softly - more ripe Satsuma than red grapefruit and there’s
  definitely biscuit malt to mellow the swallow. Light bodied with a pleasant soft
  finish with bitter languor.
