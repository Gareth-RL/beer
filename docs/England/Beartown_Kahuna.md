| **Comments** | So it promises and delivers some passionfruit in the aroma. Frankly it could pass for gooseberry. Pours clear golden body with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Easy drinking which in this case is not a euphemism for forgettable. |
