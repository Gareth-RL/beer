Comments: So it promises and delivers some passionfruit in the aroma. Frankly it could
  pass for gooseberry. Pours clear golden body with thin lace top. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish. Easy drinking which in this case is not a euphemism for
  forgettable.
