| **Comments** | Cask. Pours light amber gold with white lace top. Aroma is hop fruits of the non-citric kind. Taste is medium bitter with light sweetness initially. Palate is medium to light body, average to soft carbonation, tacky feel &#40;whatever the opposite of smooth is&#41;, finish is not short but not languid  |
