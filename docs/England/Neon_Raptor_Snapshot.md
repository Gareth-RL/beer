Comments: Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma of nectarine grapefruit and pine. Medium sweet to bitter with more grapefruit and a hint of apricot. Then a piney hop finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Well you take a cask Neon Raptor where you find it.
