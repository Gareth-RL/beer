| **Comments** | Cask at The Keans Head Nottingham. It pours like an Irish stout and smells like it too. So that means black body creamy tan top and slightly sweet malt scent. The downside to the non-Hibernian is that it tastes Irish too. No matter how far from the Liffy it was brewed. So medium sweet to lightly bitter and a palate that is not much above medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a soft light finish. Could pass for Guinness among the uninitiated if it had a bit more bitterness. So should sell well. |
