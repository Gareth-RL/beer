Overall: 14.0
MyScore: 3.3
Comments: Poured reddish amber body, off white foamy head (another can that misbehaved). Aroma of caramel malt with background hops. Medium sweet to bitter with a similar mix some toffee and a little autumnal fruit. Medium bodied, oily texture, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall a decent bitter but probably better on draft.
