| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky orange peach juice. Aroma is emphatically mango passionfruit with maybe some vanilla lurking in the peach notes. Taste is fruit sweet initially but thereafter there is a bitter build up rather than a souring so the lactose does not work well in my view. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter acerbic finish. Not convinced this could have been a decent APA, I suspect. |
