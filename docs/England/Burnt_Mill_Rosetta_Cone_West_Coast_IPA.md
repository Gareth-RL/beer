Comments: '"I blame the cognoscenti but then that''s a tendency I have. But in my
  search for American styled beer a West Coast IPA served this July 4. An interesting
  hop mix aromatically. Grassy, herbal, citrus on the grapefruit/ lemony end, and
  melon with even a backnote of spice. My nose is off to a darkened room. Relatively
  clear golden given the murk that predominates. 27/04/20 second sipping. The aroma
  is the same. The taste is lightly sweet to sour with a bitter finish, Palate is
  medium bodied, soft to average carbonation, and a souring bitterness in the tail.
  I wish I could drink it in an appropriate beer garden or pub."'
