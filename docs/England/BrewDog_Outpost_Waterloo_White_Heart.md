| **Comments** | A white stout. Poured amber body thin lace top. Toffee malt and vanilla aroma. Sweet like a cappuccino. Lots of vanilla atop coffee malts. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a light finish that refuses to settle on bitter. As sweet as a pastry stout. |
