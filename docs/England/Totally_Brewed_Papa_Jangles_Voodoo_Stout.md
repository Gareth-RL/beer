| **Comments** | Cask at the Falcon. Aroma is good for those who like sweet notes; for me, more marshmallows than cookies. But there’s yeasty notes as well. My pint was dark with ruby tints and a definite cream top which smeared rather than laced the glass. Taste was less full than expected. Watery but the milky chocolate is more evident. I maybe wrongly expect stout to have more body. But this is very palatable. Second sipping 29/09/19  £2.50 a pint and despite accusations of bribery this time, I was harsh the first time around. |
