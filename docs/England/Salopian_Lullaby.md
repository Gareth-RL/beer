| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden amber brown with off white lace thin top. Aroma has tropical fruit mango papaya lychee mix but nothing overpowering. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with some alcohol heat at the back. Palate is medium bodied, sticky almost creamy texture, average to soft carbonation, and a soft balanced finish. Some DIPA at 9% abv have a burn in the finish but this one has it initially but it dissipates. Overall more pluses than minuses. |
