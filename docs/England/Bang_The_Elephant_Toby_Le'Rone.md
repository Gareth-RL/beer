Comments: Poured black body tan halo. Aroma chocolate yes honey possibly almond vanilla no. Medium sweet but not in a nutty toblerone kinda way. The honey is there and a little chocolate but curiously understated. The best of the flavour is in the finish. Not one of the Elephant's best by any means.
