| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden amber with white lacing. Aroma is muted, some biscuit malt with toffee note on the tongue. Taste medium sweet that faded to bitter. Described as a citrus pale by the management presumably on the basis of the hop not the beer.. It isn&#39;t. Palate medium bodied, soft carbonation, oily feel, and a bitter languor. I can recall drinking many ales like it in the wasted years. |
