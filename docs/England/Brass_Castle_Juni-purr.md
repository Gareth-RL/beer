Comments: 'Cask at The Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours golden with thin lace top.
  Aroma is herbal/ medicinal so I guess that is juniper. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a soft
  finish. Over chilled which may have impaired the flavour but fair enough '
