| **Comments** | Cask at The Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours golden with thin lace top. Aroma is herbal/ medicinal so I guess that is juniper. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a soft finish. Over chilled which may have impaired the flavour but fair enough  |
