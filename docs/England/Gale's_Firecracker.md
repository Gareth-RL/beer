Comments: 'Cask. A spiced winter ale for Christmas. Aroma predictably ginger spice.
  Look - rich copper with white top. Taste spiced fruit and roasted malt. Reasonably
  light and a soft finish. But I have still to find a Christmas beer that is better
  than other seasonal offerings. We do winter and summer better than Yuletide '
