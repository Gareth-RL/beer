| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours hazy copper orange body with thin lace top. Aroma has herbs, dough, cereal, resin, with yeasty notes predominating. Taste is medium to light bitter but with an alcohol burn. Palate is medium bodied and sticky texture with soft carbonation and a burn at the back of the throat rather than a languor. Still a bit rough this one. |
