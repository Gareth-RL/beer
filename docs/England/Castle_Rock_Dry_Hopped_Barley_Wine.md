Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Castle Rock Dry Hopped Barley Wine
BeerID: 581553
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap at the Canal House. Pours hazy copper orange body with thin lace top.
  Aroma has herbs, dough, cereal, resin, with yeasty notes predominating. Taste is
  medium to light bitter but with an alcohol burn. Palate is medium bodied and sticky
  texture with soft carbonation and a burn at the back of the throat rather than a
  languor. Still a bit rough this one.
