| **Comments** | Poured golden body with white lace top. Aroma of mandarin orange and lemon. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light peach and plum notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Pleasant enough without ever threatening to be memorable so the incredibly soft citrus finish promised clearly eluded this drinker. A glorious May afternoon with blue sky, warm sun and a gentle breeze should make you forget the ills of the world and embrace the pleasures of a decent IPA. |
