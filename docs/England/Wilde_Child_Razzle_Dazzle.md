| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body with ruby lights and tan foam lace. Aroma raspberry jam and roasted malts. Taste is full sweet with the raspberry initially then mellows a little to a light toffee malt finish. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. If this is pastry it's raspberry doughnut.                                                                                      |
