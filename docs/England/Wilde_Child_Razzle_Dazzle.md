Comments: '"Poured dark brown body with ruby lights and tan foam lace. Aroma raspberry
  jam and roasted malts. Taste is full sweet with the raspberry initially then mellows
  a little to a light toffee malt finish. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average
  to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. If this is pastry it''s raspberry
  doughnut."'
