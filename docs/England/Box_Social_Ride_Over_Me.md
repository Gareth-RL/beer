Comments: '"Meh. Says it all. It''s fruity but hardly a raspberry or general berry
  fest. Murky brown orange whereas I was expecting pink. Medium sweet but with a sugar
  twang that I associate with cheap sweets. Palate is medium bodied but sticky enough
  to feel heavier soft to average carbonation and a chalky finish. Thumbs down."'
