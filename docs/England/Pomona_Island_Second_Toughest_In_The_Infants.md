Comments: Tap at The Junkyard. Pours hazy golden with thin lace top. Aroma has fruity
  citrus hops and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium
  bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a sour finish. I can imagine
  everyone with a pint of this around the dinner table.
