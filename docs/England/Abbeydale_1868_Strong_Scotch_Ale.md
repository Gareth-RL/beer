| **Comments** | Cask at the Canal House Nottingham. Pours pale chestnut with white lace top. Aroma has toffee malts and boozy notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium to full bodied, rich smooth texture, soft carbonation and languorous finish. Like distilled butterscotch.  |
