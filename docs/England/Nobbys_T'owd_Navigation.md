| **Comments** | Aroma of fruity hops and dark malts. pours dark reddish brown with thin tan top. Taaste is medium bitter with a background of dark fruit - dates and even fig. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall I really wanted to like this because the style is so rarely found these days but it made me suspect the cellar man |
