Beer: '"Nobbys T''owd Navigation"'
BeerID: 63551
Brewer: Nobbys Brewery
City: Thrapston
Comments: Aroma of fruity hops and dark malts. pours dark reddish brown with thin
  tan top. Taaste is medium bitter with a background of dark fruit - dates and even
  fig. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  Overall I really wanted to like this because the style is so rarely found these
  days but it made me suspect the cellar man
