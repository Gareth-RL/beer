| **Comments** | Aroma of pineapples lychee tangerine and grapefruit so not what you would call understated. Pours pale gold with white lace top. Taste is sweet (above medium) but this subsides to a light bitterness in a long finish although the tropical hops never leave entirely. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long light bitter finish. Impressed. Better than expected. |
