Beer: Bone Machine Garden of Death
BeerID: 562995
Brewer: Bone Machine Brew Co
City: Hull
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky orange brown with halo of lace.
  Aroma is herbal resinous hops which can produce interesting fruit/vegetable effects
  in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture, average carbonation, and an aftertaste rather than a finish sour
  mainly like salad . So a puzzle in that it is not unpleasant but it left me with
  the unnerving thought that it might taste much the same on regurgitation.
