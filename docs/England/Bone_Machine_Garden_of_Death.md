| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky orange brown with halo of lace. Aroma is herbal resinous hops which can produce interesting fruit/vegetable effects in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and an aftertaste rather than a finish sour mainly like salad . So a puzzle in that it is not unpleasant but it left me with the unnerving thought that it might taste much the same on regurgitation. |
