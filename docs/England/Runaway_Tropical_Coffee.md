Beer: Runaway Tropical Coffee
BeerID: 564950
Brewer: Runaway Brewery
City: Stockport
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours amber with thin lace top. Aroma
  has coffee and butterscotch. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture, average to soft carbonation, bitter finish. An interesting mixture
  as the coffee is evident and so too is the fruit. Whether they complement each other
  is a more difficult question - not entirely.
