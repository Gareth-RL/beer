BeerID: 696499
Brewer: Marble Beers
City: Salford
Comments: Aroma has vanilla chai heading towards bubble gum. Pours golden honey body
  with white lace halo. Taste is medium sweet or more with tea notes. Palate is medium
  bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation, and a long finish. Decidedly different,
  but it leaves me undecided.
