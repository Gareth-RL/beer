Comments: Poured clear golden pale body white lace wash. Aroma of pale malt and berry hop. Medium sweet to bitter light hoppinrss. Decent malt spine. Captures the gulf between English and American pale. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A session pale, understated.
