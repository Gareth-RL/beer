| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours brown hazy body and thin tan top. Aroma has floral and citric hop notes. Taste is medium sweet with caramel malt back note. Palate medium bodied, oily feel, soft carbonation, creamy finish. I never knowingly encountered a blueberry but I enjoyed it from start to finish. |
