| **Comments** | Tap at Neon Raptor taproom Nottingham. Pours cloudy amber gold. Aroma of roasted malts and tropical hop. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with a nice grainy note coming through. Palate is medium bodied with sticky texture average carbonation and a lingering finish. Even the DIPA is dangerously drinkable. |
