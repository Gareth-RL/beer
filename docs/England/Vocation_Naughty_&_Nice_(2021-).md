| **Comments** | @TheCrownBeeston. Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Strong chocolate vanilla scent. Full sweet as expected but mellows along the praline front. Never cloying or over sweet although it comes close. Medium body at most, lighter feel, average to soft carbonation and a light bitter chocolate finish. It's a very drinkable chocolate stout. |
