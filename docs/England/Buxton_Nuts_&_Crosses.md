Comments: Unmistakably peanut scent with lactose back note. Full sweet with only a little moderation along the way. It's a sweet stout.  Poured brown body thin tan lace . Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a sticky finish. The more I had the less I wanted. @canalhouse  01 10 24 second sipping and second chance. I wanted to compare it to the maple syrup caramel milk stout that I tried first. The latter was subtle by comparison.  My earlier review strikes all the right cautionary notes. It's like brittle with toothache. But I was warned (and by myself)
