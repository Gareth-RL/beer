Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.

Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan lacing. Aroma is caramel
  and cake, ver sweet but with alcohol in there from the outset. Taste is full sweet
  moderating to light bitterness. Palate is medium to full, creamy texture,soft carbonation,
  long finish. I was grown up and visiting America before pecan pie entered my life
  and it never made my top 5 desserts. But I admire how they have kept control here.
