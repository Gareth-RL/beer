| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder Nottingham. Pours dark chestnut with tan foam top. Aroma has strawberry icecream as promised. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a sweet berry finish. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation and a sweet finish. The strawberry has an artificial flavour but it does what it says |
