| **Comments** | Aroma of citrus hops and pale malt. Pours yellow gold with white lace top. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. More pith than fruit on the citrus side. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I can see why it won prizes in the past almost as well as Why it won't win any more. 2/09/23 second sipping. As above. 31/07/24 third taste still Okay.  |
