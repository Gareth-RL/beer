Comments: '"Aroma of citrus hops and pale malt. Pours yellow gold with white lace
  top. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. More pith than fruit on the citrus
  side. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  I can see why it won prizes in the past almost as well as Why it won''t win any
  more. 2/09/23 second sipping. As above. 31/07/24 third taste still Okay. "'
