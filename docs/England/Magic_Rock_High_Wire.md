| **Comments** | Cask at the Bunker Hill tap takeover during Nottingham craft beer week. Pours cloudy orange with white top. Aroma of tropical citrus but lemon zest wins. I accompanied it with the house nachos to test its west coast credentials and it can survive jalapenos. Taste has a malt base with plenty of pineapples on top. If we had California sunshine in Nottingham regularly I could be converted. |
