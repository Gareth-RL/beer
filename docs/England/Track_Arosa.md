| **Comments** | Poured pale golden with thin lace top. Aroma has pale malt straw hop scent. Taste is lightly sweet swiftly souring yo a crisp bitter finish in the Helles style. I am not a lager fan and there is nothing out of character here that would convert me. But I am able to see that it is competently done. In these times especially, that should be appreciated.  I am also told by RB that this is my first Track beer which puzzles me since they have been around a while and I have been sampling a range of Manchester craft ale this last 12 months. I will have to check my own records. |
