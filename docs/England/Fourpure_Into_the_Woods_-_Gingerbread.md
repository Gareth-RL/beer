Comments: '"Biscuit malt clove and ginger aroma. Poured deep copper body with thin
  lace top. Taste is more spiced than sweet and more sweet than bitter. I guess light
  gingerbread has some of this quality but it looks better than it tastes. Medium
  bodied with smooth feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I guess it''s
  festive."'
