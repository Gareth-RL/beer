| **Comments** | Biscuit malt clove and ginger aroma. Poured deep copper body with thin lace top. Taste is more spiced than sweet and more sweet than bitter. I guess light gingerbread has some of this quality but it looks better than it tastes. Medium bodied with smooth feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I guess it's festive. |
