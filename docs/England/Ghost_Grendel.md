| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy orange gold with white lacing. Aroma is cereal, bread but a sip brings banana that will not let you go. Taste also has spice but is sweet to lightly sour beneath the definite spicy note. Palate is medium bodied sticky, soft carbonation, long finish. I recommend it as a beer if not as a Kristallweizen. |
