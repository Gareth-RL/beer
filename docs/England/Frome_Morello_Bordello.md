| **Comments** | Some cherry but muted chocolate on the nose. Pours black with thin tan lace.  Taste is medium sweet with good fruitiness. Still background chocolate. Hence the light bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture if watery bitter finish and average carbonation which doesn't help the chocolate.  So the taste is its best feature  |
