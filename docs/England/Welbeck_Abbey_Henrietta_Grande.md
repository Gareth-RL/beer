| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma grassy hops . Pours honey gold with lively foam that settles to a cream head with lace wash. Slightly nutty and bready tastes for a blonde as I associate the now ubiquitous Golden style with a crisp hop edge. But it has a definite hop finish and is solid enough with earthy bitter nites to finish. |
