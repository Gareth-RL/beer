| **Comments** | Aroma of pale malt and hops fruits. Pours pale amber with thin lace. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Some caramel malts. Texture is medium bodied watery to oily texture, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Surprised I have never reviewed it before and I will be surprised to do so again. Doesn't deliver as a 5% should. |
