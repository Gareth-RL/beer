| **Comments** | Cask. Pours chestnut with ruby lights and a tan cream top. Aroma has dark malts, cherry and vanilla notes. Taste is sweet to lightly sour but the cherry lingers. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long finish. Not sure the vanilla adds much although like the cherry it gives it an artificial after taste. |
