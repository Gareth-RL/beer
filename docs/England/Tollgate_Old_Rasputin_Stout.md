| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma richly fruity and caramel notes. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and tan top, broken lacing. Taste is mellow with toffee and berry fruits which is not always the combination found in stout. The pub beer list described it as Silky. Having never drank silk I cannot judge. But it’s smooth enough. The best tollgate I’ve had.  |
