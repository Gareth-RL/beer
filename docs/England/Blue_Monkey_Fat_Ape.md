Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma of caramel malt with citrus notes. Pours copper with white lace
  top. The initial mouthful is sweet enough to be a barley wine but it settles overall
  as the bitterness grows in the finish. But clearly this monkey can kick. 08/07/19
  second sipping. Validating the above and reminding me that ewent harsh on cask at
  one point.
