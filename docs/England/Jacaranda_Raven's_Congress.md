| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body thin tan lacing. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Medium sweet to bitter. more of the same with a rapid transition to coffee ground bitterness. Light to medium texture, watery texture,  average carbonation and a bitter dusty finish. Decent enough, although I feel the hop fruit is fairly anonymous and the smoothness needs more body to be registered. But I could drink this happily by an open fire in a pub somewhere. |
