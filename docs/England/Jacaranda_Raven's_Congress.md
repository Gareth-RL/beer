BeerID: 1174263
Brewer: Jacaranda Brewing Co.
City: Brinkley
Comments: Poured dark brown body thin tan lacing. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Medium
  sweet to bitter. more of the same with a rapid transition to coffee ground bitterness.
  Light to medium texture, watery texture,  average carbonation and a bitter dusty
  finish. Decent enough, although I feel the hop fruit is fairly anonymous and the
  smoothness needs more body to be registered. But I could drink this happily by an
  open fire in a pub somewhere.
