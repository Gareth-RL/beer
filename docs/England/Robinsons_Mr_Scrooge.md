| **Comments** | There are hops and malt in this copper brew and it appears to be beer. Amber body white lace. Taste has biscuit malt sweetness and hop fruit bitterness, each in proportions worthy of the pre-reformation Scrooge. Palate is light to medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Judging by my predecessors it is a beer that has not been in much demand anywhere and one can see why. But a thirst is a thirst after a walk in the Peaks in December. |
