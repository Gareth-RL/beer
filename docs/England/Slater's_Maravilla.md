| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has some berry fruits but nothing remarkable. Pours a nice amber clear body with off white lacing. But the taste is the thing. There are raspberry notes but they inhabit a bland desert of medium sweetness and light sourness. It could have been a sour but it certainly isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a blah, with thin to medium body flat carbonation and a slightly slick feel amidst a banal finish  |
