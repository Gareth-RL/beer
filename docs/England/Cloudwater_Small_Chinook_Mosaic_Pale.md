Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard. 2.9%&#033;&#033; That drew me. It looks like an APA
  that is murky orange yellow brown with a halo of thin lace. Aroma has hoppy fruit
  funk. Nothing special. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel,
  average carbonation, and a long, bitter, finish. So a low abv pale that is more
  than average."'
