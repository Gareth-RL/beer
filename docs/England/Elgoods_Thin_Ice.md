Beer: Elgoods Thin Ice
BeerID: 30562
Brewer: Elgoods Brewery
City: Wisbech
Comments: Cask. Pours amber with thin white to yellow top. Lacing. Aroma is malty
  toffee malt but the hops kick back in the taste. This is especially pronounced in
  the languor on the palate. In short it does what a bitter should but balance is
  the friendly face of nondescript.
