| **Comments** | Poured black body with tan cream lace top. Aroma has roasted malts and the tonka accentuates the licorice and coffee notes. Taste is sweet with more chocolate elements. Palate is medium to full, mouth coating with average to soft carbonation. I was expecting a richer palate, while this is smooth but a little bland in the finish. The tonka bean is always an intriguing addition (given its ambivalent US FDA reputation). This one seems to work in terms of releasing existing properties in the roasted malts rather than bringing itself to the fore. I hope David has another pebble handy.... |
