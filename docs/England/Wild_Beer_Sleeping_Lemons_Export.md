Beer: Wild Beer Sleeping Lemons Export
BeerID: 413217
Brewer: '"Wild Beer (Curious Brewing - St. Peter&#39;s)"'
City: Shepton Mallet
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy pale orange with thin halo.
  Aroma is salty lemon juice. Taste is medium sour with a salty tang. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, astringent finish. Overall a
  pleasant palate cleaner but would one spend a happy evening with someone drinking
  pints of this? I speak rhetorically of course.
