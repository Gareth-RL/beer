| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma meaty and malty. Medium sweet to bitter some chocolate and coffee along the way but there are other flavours that make this different -smoked meat, for instance. And a cola tang in the finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and that tang in the finish. You would never confuse Sean with Patrick. Maybe Johannes  |
