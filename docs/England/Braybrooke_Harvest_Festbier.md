| **Comments** | Grainy malt scent. Pours clear amber body and white froth top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter, nice multi-cereal notes, but with a sour mash finish. Palate is medium to light bodied, smooth transition, average carbonation for a bottle, and this bitter tang in the finish. Still finding my feet in terms of Marzen drinking. But this is more-ish. |
