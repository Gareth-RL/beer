BeerID: 869990
Brewer: Braybrooke Beer Co
City: Braybrooke
Comments: Grainy malt scent. Pours clear amber body and white froth top. Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter, nice multi-cereal notes, but with a sour mash finish. Palate
  is medium to light bodied, smooth transition, average carbonation for a bottle,
  and this bitter tang in the finish. Still finding my feet in terms of Marzen drinking.
  But this is more-ish.
