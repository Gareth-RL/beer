Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask at the Organ Grinder. Aroma of coffee malts. Pours dark body thin tan
  top and broken lacing. Tastes suitably creamy smooth and malty with a pleasant chocolate
  note and hoppy languor. I was mean last time 11/07/19 creamy texture and chocolate
  notes make this stout reliable and good without addition. 24/11/23 this is a good
  stout by which to judge the others. Sweeter than it was 4 years ago 16/11/24 this
  batch has more coffee malt.
