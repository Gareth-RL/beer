Comments: '"Pours a reddish amber with lasting off white lace. Aroma certainly has
  the damsons that the blurb promises and dark malts.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  sour and whatever else lurks in there could be bubblegum or some other confectionary
  from childhood (anyone remember things that were shaped like shrimp?). Not keen
  on the mouthfeel as it is now categorized. No more than medium bodied and this is
  reduced further by the above average carbonation, slightly sticky whenever the bubbles
  flee, and the finish is sour. So the overall impression is mixed--looks fine, smells
  interesting but something isn''t as it should be here. But it is better than several
  lagers I have had recently, although I concede that the main reason for that is
  that I am a porter fan not a lager drinker. The palate has never relished the light
  crisp Pilsner range. (We all have limits)."'
