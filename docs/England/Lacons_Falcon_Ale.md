Comments: 'From barrel at festival so a clear brown bitter with no head. Aroma with
  a gentle hop scent grassy and floral rather than fruits. Tastes like a classic bitter
  with fruit hops atop mild biscuit malts and a pleasant languor. I could once have
  drunk a lot of this and smiled. Age tells '
