| **Comments** | From barrel at festival so a clear brown bitter with no head. Aroma with a gentle hop scent grassy and floral rather than fruits. Tastes like a classic bitter with fruit hops atop mild biscuit malts and a pleasant languor. I could once have drunk a lot of this and smiled. Age tells  |
