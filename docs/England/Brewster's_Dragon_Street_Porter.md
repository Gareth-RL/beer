Brewer: '"Brewster&#39;s Brewery (UK)"'
City: Grantham
Comments: Can. Poured dark brown with ruby cast in the light. Thin lace top. Aroma
  certainly had coffee for me, amidst the roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly sour with maybe a little aniseed note. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation in the can, and a light sour finish. Overall a decent enough porter,
  although it has yet to find its level.
