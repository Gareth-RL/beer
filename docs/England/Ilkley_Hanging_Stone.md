Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Ilkley Hanging Stone
BeerID: 398471
Brewer: Ilkley Brewery
City: Ilkley
Comments: Cask. Aroma has more the more you sniff. Mild chocolate malts smoke blackcurrant
  notes. Pours dark with a creamy tan top that laces nicely. Taste has liquorice coffee
  molasses and dark berry fruits to finish. Fairly light to medium on the palate.
  It has reignited my interest in oatmeal stout which was dipping after some disappointing
  examples.
