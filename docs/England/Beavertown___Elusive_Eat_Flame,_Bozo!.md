Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. You either like it or you don&#39;t.
  Aroma is lime and mint with something sour in the background. But they aimed for
  lime and mint and hit it. Taste is medium muddled sweetness. Palate is medium bodied,
  slightly &#40;underlined&#41; creamy, soft to average carbonation, and a stale end.
  A bold move bozo and you went down in flames "'
