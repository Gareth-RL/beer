| **Comments** | A modest aroma with grassy hop notes amid pale malt.  Pours clear golden with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter. Some pleasant fruit notes in passing before a bitter finish. Texture is thin, watery feel, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. It's not clear whether this beer is named because the brewer made it in his sleep or because it's blandness is soporific. CR can do a lot better. |
