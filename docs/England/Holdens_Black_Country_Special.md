Comments: '"I will try to ensure that the misplaced apostrophe in the commercial description
  (it''s/for its) doesn''t affect my judgement. Aroma has berry hops to the fore with
  roasted malts behind. Pours amber golden body with thin lace.  Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter light citrus and caramel. Palate is light to medium bodied oily texture
  average to soft carbonation and a soft fruit finish. It grew on me."'
