| **Comments** | Pale malt and light grassy hop scent. Poured clear golden body white lace wash. Lightly sweet to lasting bitter, with rapid transition and an intensifying effect. The languor is quite astringent. Medium bodied smooth bread malt texture and a pronounced bitter finish. The finish makes it thirst quenching but I couldn't take a session of this grapefruit pith |
