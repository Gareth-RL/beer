| **Comments** | A decidedly spicy nose heading towards incense! Poured cloudy orange with initial foam dying back to thin lace. Taste is yeasty sweet with thin bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to full carbonation and a light bitter finish. I sense some secondary fermentation. But still highly drinkable |
