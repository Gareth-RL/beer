| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Now this has a strong citrus hop scent. It pours golden with an off white lace top. The taste is medium sweet to bitter and very fruity. The palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a crisp bitter finish. A find. I would gladly have it again. |
