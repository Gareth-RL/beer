Brewer: '"Harrison&#39;s Brewery"'
City: Retford
Comments: Can from Adventure Beer Company. Poured dark brown body with thin dissipating
  lacing. Aroma has stewed plums. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. The plum
  essence gives a slightly jam-like quality and rather knocks the other elements of
  the porter into touch. Medium bodied, tacky feel, average carbonation, and a sour
  finish. I prefer the regular Porter.
