Beer: 'Hartshorns Reaper '
BeerID: 407652
Brewer: Hartshorns Brewery

Comments: Cask. Aroma grapefruit and pale malt. Pours bright amber with thin lace.
  Taste has a more definite citric tang yellow rather than red grapefruit. Soft carbonation
  and some grassy finish. A summer brew by my reckoning and more reliable than the
  weather.
