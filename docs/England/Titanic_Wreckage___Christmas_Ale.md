| **Comments** | As a seasonal brew this seems to have had quality control issues on cask release and bottles in Scandinavia.  But mine is fine. Aroma has rich malty toffee malt. Some light citrus. Poured copper body and white lace. Taste is medium sweet to very light bitter but the alcohol is managed. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Decent if deceptively strong. |
