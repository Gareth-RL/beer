Beer: Titanic Wreckage / Christmas Ale
BeerID: 5761
Brewer: Titanic Brewery (UK)
City: Stoke-on-Trent
Comments: As a seasonal brew this seems to have had quality control issues on cask
  release and bottles in Scandinavia.  But mine is fine. Aroma has rich malty toffee
  malt. Some light citrus. Poured copper body and white lace. Taste is medium sweet
  to very light bitter but the alcohol is managed. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Decent if deceptively strong.
