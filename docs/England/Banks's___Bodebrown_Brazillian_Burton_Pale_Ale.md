Brewer: '"Banks&#39;s Beer (Carlsberg Marston&#39;s Brewing Co.)"'
City: Wolverhampton
Comments: Cask. Aroma earthy leaves but all rather muted. Pours amber with off white
  cream top. Taste has bready malts and some berry fruit, but again it’s background
  noise that reflects a balance that represses rather than elevates the flavours.
  Reminds me of the many forgotten bitters of my youth. A salutary warning to enjoy
  today.
