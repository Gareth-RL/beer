| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma earthy leaves but all rather muted. Pours amber with off white cream top. Taste has bready malts and some berry fruit, but again itâ€™s background noise that reflects a balance that represses rather than elevates the flavours. Reminds me of the many forgotten bitters of my youth. A salutary warning to enjoy today. |
