Comments: '"Cask at the Company Inn &#40;JDW&#41;. Pours dark with ruby lights and
  tan foam top. Aroma has dark fruit and toffee malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.
  Palate is thin to medium and perhaps it&#39;s the texture that lets it down. Carbonation
  average and finish has length. This was once a champion and I am glad to see it
  back in circulation but what a world of improvement separates the beer of the early
  90s and today?"'
