| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours hazy golden with white lace top. Aroma is key and it&#39;s this beer&#39;s standout feature: There&#39;s papaya and mango atop a mandarin orange lychee platform. Sadly the taste is relatively disappointing being a mediocre bitter and the palate similarly doesn&#39;t match the aromatic intro. It&#39;s medium  to light bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation and what the manual describes as an abrupt finish and as guys all over the world know that is not a good sign. But it remains a  lot for a. 3.8% beer. |
