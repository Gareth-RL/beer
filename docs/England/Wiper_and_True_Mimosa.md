| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours clear pale yellow gold. White foam top. Aroma has indeed a papaya passionfruit blend with some lemon and melon to the taste. Taste is medium sweet to sour with grapefruit pith to finish. Palate is never more than medium bodied, texture is sticky, or at least full coating. Carbonation average. Finish is too soon. It made up for an indifferent bitter I tried earlier. |
