| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured dark brown with ruby lights and a tan foam top. A roasted malt aroma with hints of toffee and licorice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some chocolate notes and dark fruits and licorice in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall, a very pleasant porter. I could drink more than one! |
