Comments: Bottle. Poured dark brown with ruby lights and a tan foam top. A roasted
  malt aroma with hints of toffee and licorice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with
  some chocolate notes and dark fruits and licorice in the finish. Palate is medium
  bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall, a very
  pleasant porter. I could drink more than one!
