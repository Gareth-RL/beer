BeerID: 464917
Brewer: Abbeydale Brewery
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask. Pungently citrus and sherbet. Pours golden pale with white lace top.
  It sys pale on the pump clip and boasts of centennial hops but the lager ascription
  is more a product of distant Spanish holidays. That said, there’s more flavour than
  the term implies for me. And the finish is soft rather than crisp so forgive the
  blunder but it’s not an IPA either. But it’s the best of a brief survey.
