| **Comments** | Cask. Pungently citrus and sherbet. Pours golden pale with white lace top. It sys pale on the pump clip and boasts of centennial hops but the lager ascription is more a product of distant Spanish holidays. That said, there’s more flavour than the term implies for me. And the finish is soft rather than crisp so forgive the blunder but it’s not an IPA either. But it’s the best of a brief survey. |
