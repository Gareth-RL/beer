| **Comments** | Cask. Chocolate and coffee malts on the nose. Pours expresso dark with thin bubble top. Taste is initially dark chocolate and cough mixture with liquorice. There may be treacly qualities as well. Not sure one could get to light speed with this one but you might wake up feeling like a wookie.  |
