| **Comments** | On cask it's Single Hop Citrus. Poured golden body with thin lace top. Aroma of light citrus. Taste is medium to light sweet to medium bitter with some drying finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to watery carbonation (which is rare in cask). Overall, a golden bitter with a deepening bitter finish. I sometimes think brewers learn more than drinkers from a single hop ale. |
