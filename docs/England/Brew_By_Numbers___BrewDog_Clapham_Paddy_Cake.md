Comments: '"I expect a Saison to be light and refreshing and this is something else.
  Aroma has roasted chocolate malt and berry. Pours reddish brown with thin fading
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour but with a lot of colliding notes that
  confuse rather than enhance. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation
  and a sour finish amid the static. BBNO can try again as I won''t."'
