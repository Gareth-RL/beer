| **Comments**  | Poured cola brown body tan cream top (it looks the part). Aroma strangely muted. Light chocolate malt. Medium sweet milk chocolate cocoa powder but not the pastry mouth coating I was expecting. On the other hand that means it's less overwhelming than some. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Overall it could be cask but will disappoint the craft beer crew.
