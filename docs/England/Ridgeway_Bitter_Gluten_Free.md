Comments: '"I wonder whether the gluten free version is so much different from the
  original (which I have never sampled but has been around for a decade). Pours clear
  amber body with solid lace top --it''s a classic looking bitter. Aroma is full of
  English understatement: a bit of caramel malt, a drop of grassy hop, but nothing
  to take the breath away. And the taste is similar with balanced, blending to bland.
  Palate is medium bodied, carbonation is average, texture is smooth[ish] and the
  finish is bitter but lightly. One could drink it every day and scarcely know the
  difference! (But how come it says quite loudly on the label Ridgeway of Oxfordshire
  whereas this has added to my dismal West Sussex score?!)"'
