BeerID: 378770
Brewer: Rudgate Brewery
City: York
Comments: Cask. Aroma of toasted malts. Pours brown honeyed amber with thin swirl
  but little head. The Scottish notes are in the taste which switchbacks from toffee
  caramel to Arbroath Smokey. It may be peat but it smacks of kipper. I’m not sure
  I could take an evening in the smokehouse., but it does its job.
