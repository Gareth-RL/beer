| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of toasted malts. Pours brown honeyed amber with thin swirl but little head. The Scottish notes are in the taste which switchbacks from toffee caramel to Arbroath Smokey. It may be peat but it smacks of kipper. Iâ€™m not sure I could take an evening in the smokehouse., but it does its job. |
