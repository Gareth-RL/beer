| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma roasted malts and grassy hops. Pours dark brown white top with strong lacing. Lurking amidst the malt is the lemony sting of Sorachi hops which the palate detected better than the lips. To quote Dr Johnson &quot;One is not surprised that itâ€™s not done well, but baffled that it is attempted at all. |
