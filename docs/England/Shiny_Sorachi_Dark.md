Beer: Shiny Sorachi Dark

Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Cask. Aroma roasted malts and grassy hops. Pours dark brown white top with
  strong lacing. Lurking amidst the malt is the lemony sting of Sorachi hops which
  the palate detected better than the lips. To quote Dr Johnson &quot;One is not surprised
  that it’s not done well, but baffled that it is attempted at all.
