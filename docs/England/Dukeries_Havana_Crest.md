Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 8.0
Beer: Dukeries Havana Crest
BeerID: 388215
Brewer: Dukeries Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: Cask. Aromas of smoked and roasted malts. Light chestnut body thin lace
  top. Tastes sweetly of burnished malt with a mild bitterness to close. A bit of
  a mystery since the smokiness is hardly Havana and the aim of the brewer is unknown.
  Palatable but hardly one to seek out.
