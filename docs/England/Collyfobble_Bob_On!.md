| **Comments** | poured amber body white lace. Aroma of roasted malt and berry hop. Medium sweet to bitter with a light twiggy finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly a decent example of the style and a new brewery to me. Session worthy if the occasion requires. |
