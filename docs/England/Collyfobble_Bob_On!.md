BeerID: 540494
Brewer: Collyfobble Brewery
City: Barlow
Comments: poured amber body white lace. Aroma of roasted malt and berry hop. Medium
  sweet to bitter with a light twiggy finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly a decent example of the style and a new
  brewery to me. Session worthy if the occasion requires.
