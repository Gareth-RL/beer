Comments: Poured golden body thin lace top.  Light citrus scent. Medium sweet to bitter with grapefruit and light pale malt but purity seems to travel lightly.  Light body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Alas it has become a staple at my nearest watering hole. Good fellow George.
