| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours golden honey brown with white foam lace top. Aroma is herbal pine hops with the odd vanilla note. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long finish. Overall a beer whose appeal grows as you taste but never quite goes from good to excellent. 26/06/23Still very good. |
