Comments: '"Tap at the Crafty Crow Nottingham. Aroma has as much chocolate fudge as
  any cake I&#39;ve encountered. Pours very dark brown with tan lacing. Taste is full
  of chocolate cherry fudge goodness. Palate is between medium and full bodied as
  the carbonation is soft to flat, texture is smooth if more milk than cream, and
  the finish is languorous chocolate. It&#39;s been a while since I rated a local
  beer this highly. Well done&#033;"'
