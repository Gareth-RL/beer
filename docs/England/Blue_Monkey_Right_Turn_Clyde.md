| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours blonde gold. Cream top. Aroma grapefruits and grassy. All of this is trademark BM. Smooth taste with far less citrus than you might expect. Some sweetness but swiftly balanced. And little languor. For anyone looking for a pale that drinks like a session bitter - here you are. And yet, itâ€™s like sex without the love. Not to be despised, sure, but certainly not to be preferred. |
