Beer: Blue Monkey Right Turn Clyde
BeerID: 253444
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours blonde gold. Cream top. Aroma grapefruits
  and grassy. All of this is trademark BM. Smooth taste with far less citrus than
  you might expect. Some sweetness but swiftly balanced. And little languor. For anyone
  looking for a pale that drinks like a session bitter - here you are. And yet, it’s
  like sex without the love. Not to be despised, sure, but certainly not to be preferred.
