Comments: Cask. Pours dark brown almost black with good tan creamy top. Aroma is chocolate,
  sweet malts, and dark fruit. Taste is full bodied, creamy,medium sweetness, edging
  towards heavy. Carbonation is soft and the the long finish has a bitter quality
  by way of balance. A stout to return to.
