| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark brown almost black with good tan creamy top. Aroma is chocolate, sweet malts, and dark fruit. Taste is full bodied, creamy,medium sweetness, edging towards heavy. Carbonation is soft and the the long finish has a bitter quality by way of balance. A stout to return to. |
