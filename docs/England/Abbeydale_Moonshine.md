Comments: '"Cask. Pale yellow with white head. Aroma of citrus, mainly lemony. Taste
  matches with melon and grapfruit to the fore and biscuit malt n the background.
  Far in the background and although this golden ale slips down easily that’s the
  main defect too little body. But at the end of a pleasing Sunday with Monday still
  hours away, it works. 10/25/23 @the reopened hand & Heart . Better body some citrus.
