| **Comments** | Cask. Pale yellow with white head. Aroma of citrus, mainly lemony. Taste matches with melon and grapfruit to the fore and biscuit malt n the background. Far in the background and although this golden ale slips down easily thatâ€™s the main defect too little body. But at the end of a pleasing Sunday with Monday still hours away, it works. 10/25/23 @the reopened hand & Heart . Better body some citrus.  |
