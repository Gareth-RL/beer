| **Comments** | From the barrel at the Great Central Beer Festival. The find of the festival. Pours dark ruby lights. Tan top. Aroma richly chocolate coffee malts and a hint of vanilla. Taste is medium to strong sweet and bitter with the vanilla smoothness resisting any sour tendency. Full to medium body, soft to flat carbonation and a languorous finish. Well done Gloucestershire man! Second sipping. 31/10/19 Some dark malts but nothing like my first. And that's the tale now I would rate it no higher than 3.2 so 6/4/6/4/12. |
