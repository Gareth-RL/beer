Comments: '"From the barrel at the Great Central Beer Festival. The find of the festival.
  Pours dark ruby lights. Tan top. Aroma richly chocolate coffee malts and a hint
  of vanilla. Taste is medium to strong sweet and bitter with the vanilla smoothness
  resisting any sour tendency. Full to medium body, soft to flat carbonation and a
  languorous finish. Well done Gloucestershire man! Second sipping. 31/10/19 Some
  dark malts but nothing like my first. And that''s the tale now I would rate it no
  higher than 3.2 so 6/4/6/4/12."'
