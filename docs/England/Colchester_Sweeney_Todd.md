Beer: Colchester Sweeney Todd
BeerID: 504671
Brewer: Colchester Brewery
City: Colchester
Comments: Cask. Aroma caramel malts. Pours dark amber, creamy off white top. Taste
  light to medium sweet and then the souring. Palate medium to full bodied, slick
  texture, soft carbonation, and a sour finish. Something else lurks on the tongue
  that may need washing with another beer. Once all real ale was on this model.
