| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma caramel malts. Pours dark amber, creamy off white top. Taste light to medium sweet and then the souring. Palate medium to full bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a sour finish. Something else lurks on the tongue that may need washing with another beer. Once all real ale was on this model. |
