Brewer: Fuggle Bunny Brew House
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask. Aroma roasted malts with chocolate and toffee notes. Pours black with
  tan foam top. Taste has medium sweet medium bitter. Some creamy texture and a slick
  finish. But no imperial characteristics really. It’s a stout. 7/09/24 7 years later
  second sipping. Still chocolate scent. More coffee in the taste. Bitter coffee grounds
  finish.  And they really need to strike the Imperial reference from the pump clip.
