| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma roasted malts with chocolate and toffee notes. Pours black with tan foam top. Taste has medium sweet medium bitter. Some creamy texture and a slick finish. But no imperial characteristics really. Itâ€™s a stout. 7/09/24 7 years later second sipping. Still chocolate scent. More coffee in the taste. Bitter coffee grounds finish.  And they really need to strike the Imperial reference from the pump clip. |
