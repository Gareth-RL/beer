| **Comments** | It almost lost a point for a dreadful pun on a non Xmas theme, but that's hardly the spirit of the season. I think you should reward a brewer who achieves what she sets out to achieve, and this is a Xmas pudding of a stout.. Aroma has dark fruit and marzipan and spice. Taste is rich and sweet. Like the pudding itself is small slice may suffice.  Palate is medium bodied at least with a treacly feel and soft carbonation. The finish is long and cake infused. I struggled to finish a third but that's just my intrinsic wimpiness. |
