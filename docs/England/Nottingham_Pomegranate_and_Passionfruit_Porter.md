| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma gas muted coffee and chocolate notes on a generally malty nose. Pours mahogany black with tan cream top. Taste has dark fruit and caramel but neither passionfruit nor pomegranate make themselves known &#40;thank goodness&#41;. But the result is a smooth and rich tasting porter that I will happily return to. |
