Brewer: Twisted Brewing
City: Westbury
Comments: Cask. Muted aroma of biscuit malts. Classic copper body and diminishing
  pale top for an English bitter. Softly textured, with a smooth blend of hop fruits
  and bread malts. Hop fruits more evident in the sour finish. Unlikely to be a beer
  I deliberately revisit.
