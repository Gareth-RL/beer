Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Poured cola black thin lace. Strong marshmallow vanilla candy scent. Taste
  is medium to full sweet with some chocolate malts adding bitterness. Palate is thin
  soft carbonation and a slight grainy finish. For an imperial stout it lacks depth
  but the taste of coconut and vanilla justifies the label.
