| **Comments** | Poured cola black thin lace. Strong marshmallow vanilla candy scent. Taste is medium to full sweet with some chocolate malts adding bitterness. Palate is thin soft carbonation and a slight grainy finish. For an imperial stout it lacks depth but the taste of coconut and vanilla justifies the label. |
