BeerID: 393320
Brewer: Milestone Brewing
City: Newark
Comments: Cask. Aroma of dark stewed fruits more prunes than dates, and hints of chocolate.
  Dark mahogany with a tan cream head and good lacing. Taste has caramelized malts
  and fruits to the fore, although the bitterness grows on the palate. Overall a decent
  ESB if not a classic.
