| **Comments** | Aroma has citrus hop and caramel malts. Pours hazy reddish amber with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. I am struggling to find a Buxton beer that impresses, which may be due to the selection CV available locally or my own peculiarities, but too many are unremarkable. |
