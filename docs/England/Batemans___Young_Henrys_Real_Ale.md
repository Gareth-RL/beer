| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma biscuity malty with hints of spice. Light copper body lasting thin lace top. Taste is balanced with malts at the fore and hops to the rear so one moves from smooth to sharp; mild caramel to acidic bitter, although neither is pronounced. Fine but bland. A safe beer for a session but not one to travel to find. |
