| **Comments** | Hallmark aroma for the cask ale apparently is caramel malts Reddish brown no head to speak of. Despite hints of dark fruit in the scent it is not overly sweet. And there is a growing bitterness on the palate. Personally I found the palate more watery than smooth. However one has to make allowance for a pour from the barrel at a festival. I would certainly drink it again. |
