Comments: '"Not sure if bitter benefits from the single hop approach. Aroma wise is
  barnyard funk. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but there''s still a funk in there
  and I would be happy to lose it. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. The forecast is sunny interval"'
