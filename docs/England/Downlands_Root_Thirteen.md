| **Comments** | Aroma of roasted malts and pineapple hops . Pale golden body with white lace top. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Nice fruitiness but acidic finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  One for the summer rather than autumn drizzle. |
