Beer: Double Top Tungsten
BeerID: 348399
Brewer: Double Top Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with ruby lights and a tan foam top. Aroma dark malts with
  caramel and chocolate mildly. Taste is sweet with a slow souring. Palate is medium
  bodied, rich and smooth texture, average carbonation, and the finish is slow if
  not exactly languorous. And the licorice that has just emerged gets an extra point
