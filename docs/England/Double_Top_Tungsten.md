| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark with ruby lights and a tan foam top. Aroma dark malts with caramel and chocolate mildly. Taste is sweet with a slow souring. Palate is medium bodied, rich and smooth texture, average carbonation, and the finish is slow if not exactly languorous. And the licorice that has just emerged gets an extra point |
