| **Comments** | Tap at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours dark with brown creamy tan top. Aroma has coffee, chocolate, malts with an alcohol buzz. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium at most in terms of body &#40;my one serious misgiving&#41;, but smooth if thin, carbonation soft, and a bitter finish. So a very good imperial in terms of taste and smoothing out the burn of the abv, but a tad watery. |
