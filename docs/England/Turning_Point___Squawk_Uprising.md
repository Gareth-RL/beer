| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours very murky red brown with off white lacing. Aroma is pungently malty some toffee some bread, and berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet with some yeasty undertones. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a soft sour finish. Listed as Belgian red which is not much seen in Nottingham  |
