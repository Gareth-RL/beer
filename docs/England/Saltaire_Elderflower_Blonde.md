Comments: '"Cask. Pours clear golden honey brown with very thin lacing. Aroma has
  the promised elderflower and generally herbal nose. Taste is medium bitter and lightly
  sour. Not as sweet as you might fear, although there&#39;s a toothpaste tang to
  the finish. A summer beer, and there&#39;s no guarantee of summer."'
