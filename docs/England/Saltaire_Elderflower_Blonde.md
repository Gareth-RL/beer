| **Comments** | Cask. Pours clear golden honey brown with very thin lacing. Aroma has the promised elderflower and generally herbal nose. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sour. Not as sweet as you might fear, although there&#39;s a toothpaste tang to the finish. A summer beer, and there&#39;s no guarantee of summer. |
