Comments: '"Poured black bodied with tan cream lace top. Aroma has cocoa and vanilla
  coffee. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a persistent chocolate note.
  I can''t say the molasses intruded much nor vanilla. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel soft to average carbonation long finish with just a little heat towards the
  end. There was a time when this would have received a four but the quality of imperial
  ales has soared since I first sampled them and this is now very good but not excellent."'
