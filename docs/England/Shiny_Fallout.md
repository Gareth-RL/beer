Beer: Shiny Fallout
BeerID: 688683
Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Poured hazy orange gold with dissipating white foam head. Aroma is citrus
  with grapefruit dominant. Taste is lightly sweet with a drying bitterness alongside
  a lasting fruitiness. Palate is medium bodied, average to soft carbonation. Some
  mineral chalkiness in the texture and the bitter finish. A summer pale that anticipates
  the summer here.
