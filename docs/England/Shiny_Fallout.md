| **Comments** | Poured hazy orange gold with dissipating white foam head. Aroma is citrus with grapefruit dominant. Taste is lightly sweet with a drying bitterness alongside a lasting fruitiness. Palate is medium bodied, average to soft carbonation. Some mineral chalkiness in the texture and the bitter finish. A summer pale that anticipates the summer here. |
