| **Comments** | Can from Adventure Beer. Poured (nay gushed) hazy yellow with a highly foamed white lace top. Pineapple and grapefruit predominate in the tropical hop nose. Medium sweet to bitter with Mosaic and El Dorado doing their thing to make this a pretty standard NEIPA. Medium bodied, the oats ensure smoothness, average + carbonation in the can, bitter finish. I marked this generously because it seemed to me to capture the rudiments of the style. Even if the style is too prevalent these days. |
