| **Comments** | Aroma is more pineapple syrup than pineapple. Pours pale golden with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet with tropical fruits. Mango and lychee lurk lightly (if this is possible), and then there's some bitterness in the finish. Palace us medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not as interesting as the title but good enough. |
