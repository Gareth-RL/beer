| **Comments** | From the barrel tap. Pours dark, very little head. Aroma of chocolate malt is modest. However the taste certainly has mil chocolate cappuccino flavours with a soft biscotti finish. Personally I like chocolate porter that kick above their weight and edge towards stout. This was too understated. |
