| **Comments** | Poured murky cloudy orange grapefruit juice mix with spotty lace. Aroma is heady citrus with grapefruit predominant. Taste is medium sweet souring swiftly to a sharp bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, slight chalky feel but generally smooth, average to soft carbonation, and a definitely bitter drying finish. Definitely a hopfest with Citra and Mosaic delivering all they have alongside the rest of the quartet. A reminder of summer as autumn races towards us, and a reminder of why I missed Nottingham in Venice! |
