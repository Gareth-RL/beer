| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of licorice and roasted malts. Pours dark brown with ruby lights. A pleasant plummy fruit foretaste and a solid malt back with hop fruits at the edges. A good preparation for the upcoming winter ales festival 19/11/21 second sipping still pleasant. 26/10/23 third sample the licorice scent has gone but the plum taste remains. |
