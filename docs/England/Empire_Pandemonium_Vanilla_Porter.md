| **Comments** | Great scent all the vanilla you want without cloying. Poured mahogany body cream tan foam settling to lace . Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with the reservation that the vanilla always makes this more latte than espresso. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish (the vanilla never leaves). That was the main detraction the vanilla distraction. |
