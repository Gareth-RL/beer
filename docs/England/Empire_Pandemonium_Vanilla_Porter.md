Comments: Great scent all the vanilla you want without cloying. Poured mahogany body
  cream tan foam settling to lace . Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with the reservation
  that the vanilla always makes this more latte than espresso. Medium bodied smooth
  texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish (the vanilla never leaves).
  That was the main detraction the vanilla distraction.
