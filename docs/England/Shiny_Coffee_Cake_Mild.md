Beer: Shiny Coffee Cake Mild
BeerID: 735449
Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Aroma has coffee chocolate nibs scent. Pours dark brown body cream tan top.  Looks
  good enough but the taste is medium sweet with background bitterness but neither
  as rich nor as complex as I had hoped. Palate is medium bodied, creamy feel, average
  to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. It gives Mild a good name.
