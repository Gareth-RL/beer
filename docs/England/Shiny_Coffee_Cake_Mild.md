| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee chocolate nibs scent. Pours dark brown body cream tan top.  Looks good enough but the taste is medium sweet with background bitterness but neither as rich nor as complex as I had hoped. Palate is medium bodied, creamy feel, average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. It gives Mild a good name. |
