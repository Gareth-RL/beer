Comments: '"Aroma has mango and associated fruits.  Poured cloudy orange golden with
  white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to firmly bitter with quite a sharp transition.
  Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a definite sour
  coating finish. I have to concede my lack of expertise on Belgian blondes, even
  the beers, but this was a little rough for a brewery I increasingly rate. But then
  it''s the end of the tap takeover."'
