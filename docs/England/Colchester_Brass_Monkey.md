Beer: Colchester Brass Monkey
BeerID: 200232
Brewer: Colchester Brewery
City: Colchester
Comments: Aroma is pale malt and grassy hops. Pours a good golden clear body, and
  lasting white lace top. Taste is medium bitter, oily feel, average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. Curiously (at least to me) this was more bitter than the bitter
  I had just before. But I am not the first to be bewildered by the ways of a blonde.
