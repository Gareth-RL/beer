| **Comments**  | Poured ruby chestnut body tan cream top. Aroma of roasted chocolate malt. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with plenty of malt. Medium bodied slightly oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. It's a decent Mild with good flavour for the abv. At the Navigation Wilford Rd Nottingham which seems off the place list                                                                                       |
