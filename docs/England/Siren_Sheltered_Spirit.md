| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours dark brown with ruby lights and the merest halo of lace. Aroma has caramelized toffee malts and alcohol with some oak and vanilla background. Taste is fully sweet heading towards crystalized candy. Palate is full bodied with sticky texture, flat carbonation, and a sickly sweet finish. Like speculaas in Dutch. Overall it goes over the top with too much alcohol and too many sweet elements. The barrel got rid of the fire but it is better spooned onto icecream. My worst imperial. |
