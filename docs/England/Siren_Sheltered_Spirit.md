BeerID: 573768
Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark brown with ruby lights and the merest halo of lace. Aroma
  has caramelized toffee malts and alcohol with some oak and vanilla background. Taste
  is fully sweet heading towards crystalized candy. Palate is full bodied with sticky
  texture, flat carbonation, and a sickly sweet finish. Like speculaas in Dutch. Overall
  it goes over the top with too much alcohol and too many sweet elements. The barrel
  got rid of the fire but it is better spooned onto icecream. My worst imperial.
