| **Comments** | Aroma of dark fruits and chocolate with cacao nibs. Pours expresso with fleeting tan halo. Taste is sweet fruity and chocolatey. Could do with a bit more dark chocolate bitterness.. Palate is full bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long and largely sweet finish. A good enough dessert beer but not premier League. |
