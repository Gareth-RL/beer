Beer: Neon Raptor Bigfoot Expert
BeerID: 747133
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma of dark fruits and chocolate with cacao nibs. Pours expresso with
  fleeting tan halo. Taste is sweet fruity and chocolatey. Could do with a bit more
  dark chocolate bitterness.. Palate is full bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation
  and a long and largely sweet finish. A good enough dessert beer but not premier
  League.
