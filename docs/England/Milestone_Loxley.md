Beer: Milestone Loxley
BeerID: 61045
Brewer: Milestone Brewing
City: Newark
Comments: Poured pale clear golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has sweet berry
  fruits and grainy malts. Taste is medium sweet but with a drying finish that does
  not work well. So the medium bodied mouth drying feel is the lasting impression
  for a beer that has been around a long time with mixed reviews.
