| **Comments** | Poured pale clear golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has sweet berry fruits and grainy malts. Taste is medium sweet but with a drying finish that does not work well. So the medium bodied mouth drying feel is the lasting impression for a beer that has been around a long time with mixed reviews. |
