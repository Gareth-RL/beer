| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham which has a bit of a Black Iris tap takeover &#40;4 taps&#41;. Pours hazy orange amber with thin halo of lace. Aroma is very floral but the juniper is there to allude to the gin that was mother&#39;s proverbial downfall. Taste is muted sweet to slow sour /bitter. Slightly off-putting. Palate is medium bodied, decidedly sticky, soft carbonation, and the finish is probably the weirdest thing I have encountered since it persists at intervals. |
