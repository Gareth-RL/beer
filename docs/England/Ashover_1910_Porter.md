| **Comments** | Cask. Pours mahogany dark with tan creamy top. Aroma is malty with toffee and chocolate notes. Tastes caramelized malts and soft fruits. Palate smooth light and easy drinking for 5%. It is Ashover here with no reference to Fuller. But a pleasant brew. 31/07/24 second sipping 8 years later and I stand by my earlier comment.  |
