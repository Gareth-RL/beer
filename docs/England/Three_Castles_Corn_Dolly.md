| **Comments** | I associate golden ales with clarity. This was cloudy with a scummy top. Others have found the same. Aroma is floral hops and honeyed malts. Taste is similar medium sweet (honey) to lightly bitter with a slightly spikey biscuit finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation and a lingering finish. Decent enough |
