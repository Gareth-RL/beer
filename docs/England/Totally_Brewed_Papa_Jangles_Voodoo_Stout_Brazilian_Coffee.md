Beer: Totally Brewed Papa Jangles Voodoo Stout Brazilian Coffee
BeerID: 759953
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has definite coffee grounds and caramel malts. Pours black bodied
  with tan cream top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a coffee note on
  both sides of the spectrum. Palate is medium, creamy texture, average to soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish.  Decent enough but the Papa Jangles regular stout is to my
  mind their best product. Why mess with a winner?
