Comments: Poured amber slightly hazy off white lace and yeast spots. Aroma of mosaic hop and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet with a fruity tang and a bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nothing special 03/08/24 an inadvertent second sipping as I forgot to check the hop mix. Still uninspiring
