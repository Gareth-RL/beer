Comments: 'Poured amber slightly hazy off white lace and yeast spots. Aroma of mosaic
  hop and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet with a fruity tang and a bitter finish.
  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nothing special
  03/08/24 an inadvertent second sipping as I forgot to check the hop mix. Still uninspiring '
