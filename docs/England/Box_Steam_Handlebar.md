| **Comments** | A modest malty nose with smoky chocolate notes but nothing pungent. Poured dark chestnut body with tan lace top largely lasting. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a light chocolate note. Palate is thin to medium watery feel, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nothing stands out and it's thinner than I like. |
