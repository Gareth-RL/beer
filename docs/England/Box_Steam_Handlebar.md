Comments: '"A modest malty nose with smoky chocolate notes but nothing pungent. Poured
  dark chestnut body with tan lace top largely lasting. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with a light chocolate note. Palate is thin to medium watery feel, average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Nothing stands out and it''s thinner than I like."'
