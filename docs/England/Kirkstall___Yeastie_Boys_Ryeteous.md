Comments: Cask at The Canal House Nottingham. Aroma has apricot, spice and grain notes.
  Pours clear amber brown with thin lace top  Taste is medium sweet and bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. I guess
  this is an American style red. Certainly different.
