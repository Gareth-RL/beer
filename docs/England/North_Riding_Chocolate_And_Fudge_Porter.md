Comments: '"Aroma has cocoa powder in abundance and vanilla fudge notes. Pours dark
  body coffee tan cream top. Taste is less sweet than you might expect, with a definite
  bitter note alongside the chocolate. Palate is medium at most with quite a thin
  feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. So it''s the scent that distinguishes
  it."'
