| **Comments** | Aroma has cocoa powder in abundance and vanilla fudge notes. Pours dark body coffee tan cream top. Taste is less sweet than you might expect, with a definite bitter note alongside the chocolate. Palate is medium at most with quite a thin feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. So it's the scent that distinguishes it. |
