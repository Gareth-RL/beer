Comments: A hop mix Enigma Ekuanot Vic Secret and Simcoe. Herbal and citrus scent
  and maybe peach. Pours cloudy orange with thin white lace. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with a malty backnote. Palate is thin to medium bodied, clammy feel, average
  carbonation and a light bitter finish. Fruity. Not as good as the Unburied Treasure.
