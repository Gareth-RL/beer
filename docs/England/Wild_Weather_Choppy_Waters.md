Comments: 'Cask. Aroma bread grassy and tangerine but each of them mildly. Pours orange
  amber with off white head. So far so fair. But the taste. This claims to be an American
  Pale. And this barely makes any claim at all. It’s lasting impression is of a sickly
  sweetness. It may be the worse beer I have tasted and must be the worst I have rated.
  I rename it &quot;Boris’s Breath.&quot; In memory '
