| **Comments** | Amidst the fruit there's an ammoniacal hint of cat piss that rarely endears. Reasonably clear golden body with lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Certainly there is pineapple juice grapefruit pith and a slug of mango thrown in but it's an oddity. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall, an amendment top far. |
