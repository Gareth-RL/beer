| **Comments** | Pale malts and berry hop in the scent. Poured clear golden with lasting lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a bitter finish and a grainy note. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. English pale ale is stereotypically self effacing, the antithesis of West Coast or New England American in your face punchiness. My preference for the latter embarrasses me. |
