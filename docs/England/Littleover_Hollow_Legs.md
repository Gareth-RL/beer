Comments: Pale malts and berry hop in the scent. Poured clear golden with lasting
  lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a bitter finish and a grainy note.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. English
  pale ale is stereotypically self effacing, the antithesis of West Coast or New England
  American in your face punchiness. My preference for the latter embarrasses me.
