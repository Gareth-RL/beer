Beer: Squawk Tyto
BeerID: 602157
Brewer: Squawk Brewing Co.
City: Ardwick
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black body tan foam lacing. Aroma
  is richly malted with coffee notes and the taste underlined the espresso. Taste
  is medium sweet and bitter and nicely balanced. Palate is medium to light bodied
  for a stout, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Better than
  expected.
