| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is caramel malts and some spice. Pours copper brown with off white lace top. Taste is similarly malt heavy with roasted and toffee malts evident and just a hint of hop fruits. I rate this a reasonable if not memorable bitter. 20/06/24 second sipping  7years later. Still a decent bitt |
