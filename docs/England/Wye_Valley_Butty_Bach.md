| **Comments** | Bottle from Sainsburys. Aroma has cereal, nuts, and floral hops, with a background note of cooked vegetables. Pours a clear, light golden, amber with thin white top that does not stick around. Taste is medium sweet and lightly sour; so this bitter is reluctant to be bitter. Palate has medium body, slick feel, average carbonation, and at last a butter finish. If my luck holds this Worcestershire ale should ensure that I have had a beer from all the counties of England. Many of them have been better than this. 25/07/20 second sipping as part of my sister's kind beer donation to mark my retirement. It's safe, even if it's from Hereford not Worcestershire. |
