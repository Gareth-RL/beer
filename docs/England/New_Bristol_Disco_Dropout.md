Comments: '"Pours cloudy pale yellow with white lace top. Aroma has pale malts with
  various herbal fruity hop notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter although there''s
  more blend than transition with biscuit malt becoming more evident. Palate is medium
  bodied, clammy feel, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Its suitability as
  a session ale depends on your liking for the lingering biscuit finish."'
