| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours cloudy yellow gold with scummy white lace top. Aroma is pineapple and grapefruit and that plus mango gives the juiciness in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate medium bodied, creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, long finish but the sourness cuts effectively against the creamy texture to crisp things. Not bad at all. |
