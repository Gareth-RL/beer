| **Comments** | Bewildered. I am sampling the stouts in the Wetherspoon festival &#40;lets face it the hoppy pale ale needs no help&#41;. This is allegedly a dark brown stout. It pours copper, dark chestnut but really dark. Lace top - unusual in a stout. Woods promise the mix of a hoppy scent and coffee and dark chocolate. Well hops on the nose a little but hardly floral or spicy. And where do they buy their chocolate and coffee? Whatever I just drank, it was not a stout. It was barely a porter. And okay, I agree, it was beer. |
