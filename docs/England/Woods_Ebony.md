Comments: '"Bewildered. I am sampling the stouts in the Wetherspoon festival &#40;lets
  face it the hoppy pale ale needs no help&#41;. This is allegedly a dark brown stout.
  It pours copper, dark chestnut but really dark. Lace top - unusual in a stout. Woods
  promise the mix of a hoppy scent and coffee and dark chocolate. Well hops on the
  nose a little but hardly floral or spicy. And where do they buy their chocolate
  and coffee? Whatever I just drank, it was not a stout. It was barely a porter. And
  okay, I agree, it was beer."'
