Comments: If there is citrus in the aroma from the cask ale, it’s elusive - more earthy
  and yeasty. Good golden colou with white top. I judge the taste soft, malty toffee
  with a lasting sweetness. Lingering notes an only background bitterness. I confess
  that as a Lancastrian anything Pendle related intrigues me. The beer is fine, but
  not spellbinding.
