| **Comments** | If there is citrus in the aroma from the cask ale, itâ€™s elusive - more earthy and yeasty. Good golden colou with white top. I judge the taste soft, malty toffee with a lasting sweetness. Lingering notes an only background bitterness. I confess that as a Lancastrian anything Pendle related intrigues me. The beer is fine, but not spellbinding. |
