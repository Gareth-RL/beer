| **Comments** | Cask at the Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours clear brown chestnut with off white lace top. Aroma has slightly plummy fruits and biscuit malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a finish akin to instant coffee bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish of sorts. There are too few great brown ales&#045;&#045;still. |
