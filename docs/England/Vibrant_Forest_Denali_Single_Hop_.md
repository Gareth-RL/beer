| **Comments** | Tap @ crafty crow tap takeover. Aroma resin, butterscotch, the latter strikingly so. Pours hazy dark amber gold. White lace circle. Taste is heavy sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel, average to soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall one of the more interesting single hop variants. |
