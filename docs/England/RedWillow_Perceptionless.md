| **Comments** | Aroma has the usual tropical fruit harvest with mango and pineapple and papaya evident amidst the mandarin. Pours the equally prerequisite murky orange but with decent lacing albeit ephemeral. Taste is medium sweet to sour. So not as sweet as the nose might anticipate. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish that has a little too much acidity. So it had me and then lost me with the aftertaste. Fussy bugger, as my old mother would say (all too frequently). |
