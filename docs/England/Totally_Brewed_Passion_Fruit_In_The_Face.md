Comments: 'Cask at the Overdraught Nottingham which is a Totally Brewed tap. Pours
  golden with white lace top. Aroma is fruity with the passionfruit dominant. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium medium bodied, sticky texture, soft
  carbonation, and a long fruit finish. Can one blame a beer for being too infused
  with its eponymous flavour? '
