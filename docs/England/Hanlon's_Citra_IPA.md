| **Comments** | Poured golden body white lace top. Citrus hops pale malts in the scent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little fruit initially and then a rapid transit to bitter finish. Medium to light body slick feel average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Easy drinking and I suspect it's better on draft at a beach side pub  |
