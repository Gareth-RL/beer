| **Comments** | If you favour a beer with lemon/pineapple scent, this is for you. Pale gold body. Thin head that laces well. Neutral at first but sharper and tarter as you sip. The back taste is fuller than the fore. Thin on the palate and meant for summer. And probably a hotter one if served chilled. Not to be repeated. |
