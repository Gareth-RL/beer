| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of toasted malts. Pours dark chestnut with a thin tan top. Lace wash. Tastes mainly of the malts with hops pushed well back and only evident in the languid bitterness. Easy drinking but I rate their porter more highly. At the Lincolnshire Poacher as part of the Mild Trail. |
