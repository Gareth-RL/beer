Comments: Cask. Aroma of toasted malts. Pours dark chestnut with a thin tan top. Lace
  wash. Tastes mainly of the malts with hops pushed well back and only evident in
  the languid bitterness. Easy drinking but I rate their porter more highly. At the
  Lincolnshire Poacher as part of the Mild Trail.
