| **Comments** | Poured ruby chestnut body thin cream head. Aroma has some nutmeg and cinnamon as befits the season. Taste is medium sweet thanks to the toffee malts and there is a consistent spiced theme but thankfully not as fulsome as some mulled wine I have encountered. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a spiced bitter finish. I am amazed that it has taken me this long to rate this--after all it has been around for years. And I only placed it in the basket because I suspect my Belgian consignment may not arrive until tomorrow. Let's be diplomatic and say that this is a very English Christmas beer |
