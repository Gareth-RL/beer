BeerID: 740876
Brewer: Scribblers Ales
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has light malts and berry hops. Pale amber body and thin lace.  Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Good session bitter and first new beer from Scribblers in a
  while. Better a pun on Tale of Two Cities than a spoonerism. 13/02/20 second sipping.
  I remain an admirer of their honeyed malt.
