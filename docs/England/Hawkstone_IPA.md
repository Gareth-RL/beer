| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body lasting white lace . Aroma of pale malt and light citrus hop. Medium sweet but fleetingly as the bitterness arrives early. Drying light citrus.  Medium bodied smooth texture drying pine finish. Cant stand Jeremy Clarkson but this is okay as a session IPA. Take over @good fellow george.  |
