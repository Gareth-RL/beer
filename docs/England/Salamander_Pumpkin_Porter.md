Comments: '"Cask. Aroma stewed fruits &#40;not necessarily pumpkin maybe plum or rhubarb&#41;.
  Pours chestnut and ruby with thin lace top. A rich taste that had pleasant fruit
  and caramel notes in a smooth flowing texture that was still only medium bodied.
  Given how few good pumpkin porters appeared this Halloween it deserves a cheer 26/09/17
  back for Halloween and much the same."'
