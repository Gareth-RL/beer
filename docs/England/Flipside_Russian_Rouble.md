Comments: '"Cask at the Hand and Heart. Aroma of caramel malts with some chocolate
  notes. Some astringency but no coffee for me. Pours mahogany-black with brown bubbly
  top. Tastes more richly of chocolate, expresso and licorice with an overarching
  sweetness. Smooth. Light to medium bodied with only a lingering sense of potency
  for its strength. Given the strength and cost &#40;UK£4.40 is high for Nottingham&#41;
  it can’t meet expectations. "'
