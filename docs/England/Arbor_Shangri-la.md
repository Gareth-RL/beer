| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body with white lace top. Aroma of pale malts and grassy citric hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit forward and a pithy finish. Palate is problematic. Thin but it has a drying souring aftertaste with a chalky finish. That drops its rating significantly and I couldn't face a session. |
