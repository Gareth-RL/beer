Comments: '"Poured hazy golden body with white lace top. Aroma of the sweet shop vanilla
  and candy sugar and fruit. Peach tangerine melon duly noted by my fading olfactory
  functions. Taste is sweet medium always but fluctuating as the bitterness creeps
  in. There''s always a background lactic chalky quality that is likely to ensure
  I never return but I was looking through the cans for an abv that I could live with
  tonight and here we are. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation
  and a finish that ends up bitter, lactic and chalky. My advice would be rinse and
  spit before moving on. But then that''s always sound counsel."'
