Comments: '"Tap. A good example of getting to a beer too soon. It&#39;s a cloudy yellow
  murky glass. But the aroma is full of fruit across the pineapple grapefruit melon
  range. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium to light, average carbonation,
  sticky, long finish, that cannot decide how sour it will be. Overall I think it
  needed longer to settle."'
