Brewer: Meanwood Brewery
City: Leeds
Comments: Poured cola black no head but a halo. I like a little more on a cask porter
  . Chocolate malt vanilla barrel. Medium sweet to bitter. Some decent cocoa in there
  and coffee and maybe a hint of licorice in the finish. Medium bodied at most, slightly
  grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I will always choose a porter
  if I have a choice. This is better than average.
