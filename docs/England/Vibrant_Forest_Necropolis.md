| **Comments** | Tap @ crafty crow. Pours dark reddish brown with off white lace top. Aroma is agreeably complex: caramel, bread, nuts, spruce, herbs, soy sauce, woody, a veritable m√©lange. Taste is medium to fully sweet to bitter, although the latter is noticeably lighter. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel, soft carbonation, and a souring languor that overlays the bitterness. Overall an interesting brew, but at 8.1% it is studied in small measures.  |
