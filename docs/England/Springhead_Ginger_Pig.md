| **Comments** | Cask. The aroma is herbal probably rosemary but there is ginger in there. Pours golden with thin lace top. The ginger predominates in an increasingly mealy flavour which with the light carbonation does bring the inevitable ginger beer comparison. Thereâ€™s also an acrid residue on the palate. To be fair you get what you should expect from Ginger Pig, but this little piggy will not be taking any home. |
