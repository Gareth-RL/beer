Comments: '"Cask. You live and learn. Aroma modestly compostable. Copper out of the
  light but golden in short fools gold. Sour fruit and a bitter aftertaste. I’ll give
  this the benefit of the doubt as the previous beer did not taste so great either.
  3 March 19. Much better so maybe it doesn''t travel well in barrels. A crisp hoppy
  ale with a biscuit malt finish. "'
