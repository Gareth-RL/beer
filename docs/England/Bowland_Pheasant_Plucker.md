| **Comments** | Cask. You live and learn. Aroma modestly compostable. Copper out of the light but golden in short fools gold. Sour fruit and a bitter aftertaste. Iâ€™ll give this the benefit of the doubt as the previous beer did not taste so great either. 3 March 19. Much better so maybe it doesn't travel well in barrels. A crisp hoppy ale with a biscuit malt finish.  |
