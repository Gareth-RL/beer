Comments: Tap at the Overdraught. Pours unclear orange amber with full foam white
  lace top. Aroma is richly malted with caramel toffee and hop berry. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation,
  and a long finish. I would rate this experiment a success. Citra, Simcoe, and Vic
  Secret used.
