| **Comments** | A variant on their Stairway to Heaven ale perhaps? Earthy tropical fruit hop scents.  Clear pale golden body white lace top.  Medium sweet to bitter with pineapple apricot notes. Medium bodied slightly oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Delivers the hop profile and goes down easy.  A safe choice  |
