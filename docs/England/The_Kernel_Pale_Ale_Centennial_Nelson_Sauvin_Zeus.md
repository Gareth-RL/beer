| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy golden body, white broken lace top. Aroma has modest amounts of citrus and floral hops. Taste light sweetness medium bitter and sourness. Palate is medium bodied, carbonation average to soft. Texture slick. Finish does linger as it sours. Overall a beer that deserves fewer syllables. |
