Comments: Tap. Pours hazy golden body, white broken lace top. Aroma has modest amounts
  of citrus and floral hops. Taste light sweetness medium bitter and sourness. Palate
  is medium bodied, carbonation average to soft. Texture slick. Finish does linger
  as it sours. Overall a beer that deserves fewer syllables.
