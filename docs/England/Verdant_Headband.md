Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy amber and off white lace top.
  Aroma tropical fruit with peaches. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily feel, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Juicy to be sure but a
  bit mono rather than stereo if you know what I mean.
