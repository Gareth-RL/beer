Beer: Très Bien Porter
BeerID: 346185
Brewer: Très Bien Brewery
City: Tur Langton
Comments: Cask. Aroma has licorice and dark fruits. Body is black coffee with scummy
  tan top and broken lacing. Taste is similarly somewhere between cough syrup and
  date tray. Medium body with soft sweet finish that sours on the palate but in a
  good way. For those who patrol the porter stout border, this is transsexual.
