Beer: Springhead Barebones
BeerID: 25100
Brewer: Springhead Brewery
City: Laneham
Comments: Cask. Pours amber with thin top. Some lacing. Watery but with some fruit
  but with quite a lasting bitter languor on the palate that ensures that the hops
  build like calcium in the bone. It will never be a favorite but solid enough.
