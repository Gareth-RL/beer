Comments: '"Cask at the Joseph Else. Pours reddish brown with no great head, just
  a thin top. Aroma is nutty and caramel malt with some berry fruits on the tongue.
  Taste is medium bitter with light sweetness before and light sourness to finish.
  Palate is light to medium bodied, texture is oily, carbonation soft to average,
  finish is meekly sour. I think we need an Old Ale month to promote the style and
  a discount for the under 30s to make em try it&#033;"'
