| **Comments** | Poured cola brown body thin lace. Aroma of toffee malt and dark fruit. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with toffee spine and dark fruits (yum). Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Overall very nice and a great addition to the Mild Trail 2024. Sampled at the Birdhide in Chilwell near the Attenborough Nature Reserve, one of the more outlying Nottingham trail venues. |
