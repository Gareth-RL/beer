| **Comments** | Cask at the Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours rich brown amber with white lace top. Aroma of biscuit and toffee malt. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. It&#39;s a collaboration with Cuckoo with input from the University of Nottingham brewing centre. Sold to benefit Nottingham Industrial Museum. All of which makes me wish it were better than it is. |
