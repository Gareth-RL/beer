Comments: '"Cask at the Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours rich brown amber with white
  lace top. Aroma of biscuit and toffee malt. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. It&#39;s
  a collaboration with Cuckoo with input from the University of Nottingham brewing
  centre. Sold to benefit Nottingham Industrial Museum. All of which makes me wish
  it were better than it is."'
