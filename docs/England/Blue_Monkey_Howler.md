BeerID: 284122
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma has a definite scent of blackberries atop the malt. Pours dark
  brown with red notes. Thin top but lacing. Taste has the same sense of blackberries
  on biscuit malt with some hoppy zing at the end. I enjoyed this and would welcome
  it to the monkey colony beside the apes and baboons and chimps who drink tea. Second
  sipping 10/01/20 the blackberries disappeared but that may be down to my nose which
  lacks subtlety currently.There is fruit but I cannot place it. Still decent and
  if ever a monkey was named for a time in history, howler was.
