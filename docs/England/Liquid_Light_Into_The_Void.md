BeerID: 592223
Brewer: Liquid Light Brewing Company
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma has coffee and roast dark malts.
  Pours dark brown almost black body with creamy tan top. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter with a slightly smoky ashy finish. Palate is the disappointment.
  Medium bodied at best with some oily feel but still thin. Average carbonation and
  a slightly smoked finish. Overall, it begins well and then falls away with the ashen
  finish a bit of a puzzle.
