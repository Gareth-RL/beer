| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma has coffee and roast dark malts. Pours dark brown almost black body with creamy tan top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a slightly smoky ashy finish. Palate is the disappointment. Medium bodied at best with some oily feel but still thin. Average carbonation and a slightly smoked finish. Overall, it begins well and then falls away with the ashen finish a bit of a puzzle. |
