Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy orange with broken lace top.
  Aroma has latent pineapple hop and some roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet with
  light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation,
  and a light bitter finish. Given the scope, slightly disappointing and not proportionately
  better than the double.
