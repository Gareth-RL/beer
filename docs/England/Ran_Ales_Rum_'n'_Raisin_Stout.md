Comments: 'Cask at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Aroma was raisins but any rum was muted.
  Pours dark body deep tan top. Taste is medium to light sweet to bitter with a rum
  note that drifts to licorice. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation
  and a definite bitter finish. The rum & raisin label may raise expectations unduly '
