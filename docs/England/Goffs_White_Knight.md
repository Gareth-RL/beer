Comments: '"Poured pale golden body white lace top.  Light hop and biscuit malt scent.  Medium
  sweet to bitter with some grass and pine hop notes in the finish. Light to medium
  bodied dusty malt texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  It''s alright
  but the brewers notes insist it''s an English pale ale.[ Gold & Silver Awards Winner
  - Wales & West SIBA Beer Competition 2019! A well hopped English IPA with a light
  colour and full bodied taste. Deceptively drinkable for it''s strength!] I quote
  as 4.7% is no longer strong for a pale..."'
