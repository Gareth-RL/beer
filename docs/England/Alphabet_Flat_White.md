| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours amber orange honey body and thin off white lace top. Aroma has herbs, nuts, with toffee notes. Taste is medium sweet that lingers to a diminishing bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a long finish, even if muddled. Just as a flat white is a spoiled coffee that is neither cappuccino nor Americano, but tastes fine, this is neither stout nor breakfast. |
