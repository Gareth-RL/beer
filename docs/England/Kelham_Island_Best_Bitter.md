| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma nutty malt fruity hop. Brewery claims it’s straw coloured bu mine was amber and I would not want anything to do with brown straw. Thin off white top. Strong sheet lacing. Taste had strong biscuity malts to the fore there’s fruit in the languor which is also floury. Once lots of beer tasted like this, but fortunately times have changed. |
