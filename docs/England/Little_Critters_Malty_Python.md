Comments: '"Aroma is hedge berry and roasted malts. Pours amber and white lace top.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter, oily texture, average carbonation, and the regulation
  biscuit bitter finish. Malty, yes, but its hold on my affections is less than Python-like.
  Certainly not as memorable as a dead parrot. 15)02/24 as if to prove me right 7
  years later I am trying it again and it''s the same and won''t improve my S Yirks
