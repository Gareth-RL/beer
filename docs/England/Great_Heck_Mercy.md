| **Comments** | Cask. Pungent aroma of citrus grapefruit lemon zest. Pours blonde gold as prescribed Taste is predominantly citric with melon and lemon zest still evident . Light crisp and refreshing. You may like or loathe it but if blonde ales are set to dominate the cask scene then this may be the future  |
