| **Comments** | From Adventure Beer. Bottle. Pours black body tan foam lace. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more milk chocolate in the taste. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. I'm not sure where it falls on the milk/oatmeal boundary but certainly the dominant impression is milk stout. |
