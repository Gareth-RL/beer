Comments: '"From Adventure Beer. Bottle. Pours black body tan foam lace. Coffee and
  chocolate aroma. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more milk chocolate in the
  taste. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average to soft carbonation and a light bitter
  finish. I''m not sure where it falls on the milk/oatmeal boundary but certainly
  the dominant impression is milk stout."'
