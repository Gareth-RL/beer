Comments: '"Tap @ the Junkyard. Pours golden but not clear. White lace top. Aroma
  has lemon pineapple and pine as promised. I suspect it may have rated higher if
  it had been earlier. Taste is medium across the spectrum ending predictably with
  sour. Texture is less easily placed since there is a cling that goes beyond medium
  bodied &#40;though it is&#41; and oily &#40;though it is&#41;. Carbonation is soft
  to flat and the finish is sour but not abrupt. I rate Marble as a brewery. And I
  wish they had provided beer for my wedding&#033; "'
