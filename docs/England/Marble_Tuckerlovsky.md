| **Comments** | Tap @ the Junkyard. Pours golden but not clear. White lace top. Aroma has lemon pineapple and pine as promised. I suspect it may have rated higher if it had been earlier. Taste is medium across the spectrum ending predictably with sour. Texture is less easily placed since there is a cling that goes beyond medium bodied &#40;though it is&#41; and oily &#40;though it is&#41;. Carbonation is soft to flat and the finish is sour but not abrupt. I rate Marble as a brewery. And I wish they had provided beer for my wedding&#033;  |
