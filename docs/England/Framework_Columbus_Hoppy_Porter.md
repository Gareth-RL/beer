Comments: '"Bready malt and spicy herbal hop scent. Pours ruby chestnut body with
  thin off white lace. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter as the hop bite kicks
  in. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter
  finish. As it says, it''s a hoppy porter (most are malty)."'
