| **Comments** | Bready malt and spicy herbal hop scent. Pours ruby chestnut body with thin off white lace. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter as the hop bite kicks in. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. As it says, it's a hoppy porter (most are malty). |
