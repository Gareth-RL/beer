Comments: '"I was expecting more coconut in the aroma but there''s chocolate malt
  at least. Pours dark body tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with again more
  chocolate although the coconut is there. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft
  to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall I know they can do better."'
