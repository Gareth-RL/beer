| **Comments** | I was expecting more coconut in the aroma but there's chocolate malt at least. Pours dark body tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with again more chocolate although the coconut is there. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall I know they can do better. |
