| **Comments** | Tap @ the canal House. Pours dark with tan lace circle. Aroma coffee caramel malts light vanilla. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter but as this was over chilled it was hard to judge. Palate is smooth medium bodied with average to lively carbonation, and a slight bitter finish.  |
