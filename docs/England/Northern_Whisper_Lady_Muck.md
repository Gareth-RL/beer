| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours murky pink with foamy halo of off white lace. And it took four attempts to secure my third due to the liveliness of the pour. Aroma has raspberry blackberry hedgerow and straw which degenerates to weak Ribena with a raspberry twist in the mouth. Taste is light to medium sweet. Given the lively pour it is predictably light bodied slightly sticky feel lively carbonation, abrupt finish. An experiment that didn&#39;t succeed I respectfully suggest. |
