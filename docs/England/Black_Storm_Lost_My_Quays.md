| **Comments** | Poured golden body white lace. Aroma is lightly citrus and pale malt. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Quite grapefruit pith flavoured especially in the finish. Palate light bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. The blondes don't blow me away like they used to! |
