| **Comments**  | Poured copper body white lace top. Aroma of light hedgerow hops and roasted malts.  Medium sweet to bitter balanced is the word, bland is another. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  It's so hard to make an unboring bitter                                                                                      |
