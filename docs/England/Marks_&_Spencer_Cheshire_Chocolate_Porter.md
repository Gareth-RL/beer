| **Comments** | My supermarket habit in Italy extended to the purchase of this once home. (probably a mistake). Poured dark copper brown with a fizzy diminishing head. Aroma has milk chocolate cocoa scent. Medium sweet with no real transition to bitterness; instead it rather fades away. Medium bodied, watery texture, fizzy, and a nondescript finish. It's a shame it is not a smaller bottle. I am also puzzled by the attribution to Greater London since it insists that it is brewed at Robinson's of Stockport. |
