Beer: Leatherbritches Bespoke
BeerID: 30353
Brewer: Leatherbritches Brewery
City: Ashby De La Zouch
Comments: Cask. Aroma modestly malty and nutty. Pours amber gold with white lace top.
  Taste is well balanced with hops ultimately winning but it’s a close call. Not sure
  why I don’t like this more. It could be weight of expectation. Or the prospect of
  getting up at 4am. I may re-rate another day.
