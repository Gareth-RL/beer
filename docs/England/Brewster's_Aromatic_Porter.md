City: Grantham
Comments: Cask. Aroma decidedly fruity, although maybe they changed the recipe since
  my nose read more berries than pineapples. Nothing to look at. Muddy waters with
  white film top. The taste is rich with tropical fruits so maybe the olfactory function
  finally gone. Some porter drinkers will say the fruit is disproportionate for an
  ale that is un-plummed. I liked it.
