| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma decidedly fruity, although maybe they changed the recipe since my nose read more berries than pineapples. Nothing to look at. Muddy waters with white film top. The taste is rich with tropical fruits so maybe the olfactory function finally gone. Some porter drinkers will say the fruit is disproportionate for an ale that is un-plummed. I liked it. |
