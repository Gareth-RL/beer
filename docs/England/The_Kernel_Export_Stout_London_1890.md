| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours black with tan top that would be probably be thicker in the bottled variety. Roasted aroma with coffee tar and chocolate hints but not pungent, subtle notes. A rich raisin date and prune mouthful with underlying licorice and bitter cough mixture tones. Oily and full on the palate. Overall, rich - not sure I would have managed a pint at Â£6.50 a time. |
