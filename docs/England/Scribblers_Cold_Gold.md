| **Comments** | A craft beer. New terrain for Scribblers. It retains the pleasant malt spine that's a characteristic of their core cask range. Aroma has light aroma of honey malt and fruit hop. Light spice. Pours rich golden with thin lace.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite honey quality. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Easy drinking. |
