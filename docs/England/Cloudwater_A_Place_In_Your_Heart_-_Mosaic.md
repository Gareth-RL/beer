| **Comments** | Poured cloudy pale yellow gold body white foam lace top. Aroma waxy citrus and pale malt lemon and mandarin.  Medium sweet to bitter plenty of dank fruitiness. Medium bodied juicy texture average carbonation and a bitter slightly mineral finish. Delivered the hop combo but didn't inspire me  |
