Comments: '"Cask. Pours very dark with tan head. Fruity toffee aroma. Hints of licorice
  in the mix on the taste. Full-bodied and slightly creamy on the palate. A festival
  treat. Certainly on the stouter end of the porter spectrum for me and the abv underlies
  its special status . Just goes to show that during the epic Nottingham beer festival
  the local pubs are worth a visit. 21/05/18 still a treat. 29/10/21 over three years
  since I''ve seen it around and it''s still one of L G''s best.  7/11/23 apparently
  they make it in February and age it for 9 months so worth looking out for."'
