Comments: One gets the idea.  German wheat beer has esters that yield a banana scent
  so accentuate it with banana chips.  However they added toffee extract and that
  largely eclipses the banana to give us more offee than ban. So toffee scent. Clear
  golden body white lace.  Medium sweet to lightly sour with toffee and banana. Medium
  bodied slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a sour chemical finish.  Try
  it without the toffee essence and at least one primate will be pleased.
