| **Comments**  | One gets the idea.  German wheat beer has esters that yield a banana scent so accentuate it with banana chips.  However they added toffee extract and that largely eclipses the banana to give us more offee than ban. So toffee scent. Clear golden body white lace.  Medium sweet to lightly sour with toffee and banana. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a sour chemical finish.  Try it without the toffee essence and at least one primate will be pleased.                                                                                      |
