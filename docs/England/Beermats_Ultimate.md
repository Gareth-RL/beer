| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark amber edging chestnut with off white lace top. Aroma has roasted malt and berry fruits but mutedly. Taste is medium bitter and bland. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a finish that dies before it ends. So not a fan but not an enemy either. |
