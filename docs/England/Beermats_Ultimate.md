Beer: Beermats Ultimate
BeerID: 579082
Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company
City: Winkburn
Comments: Cask. Pours dark amber edging chestnut with off white lace top. Aroma has
  roasted malt and berry fruits but mutedly. Taste is medium bitter and bland. Palate
  is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a finish that dies before
  it ends. So not a fan but not an enemy either.
