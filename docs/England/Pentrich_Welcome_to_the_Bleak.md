| **Comments** | Cask. Dark malts, ashy smoke, licorice notes. Pours chestnut brown with ruby lights and a tan cream top. Taste is medium bitter to light sweet but the smoky quality sustained the bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a long finish. A good example of smoked porter to set against the commoner fruit varieties. |
