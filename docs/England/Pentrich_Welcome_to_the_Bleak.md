Beer: Pentrich Welcome to the Bleak
BeerID: 600173
Brewer: Pentrich Brewing Co.
City: Pentrich
Comments: Cask. Dark malts, ashy smoke, licorice notes. Pours chestnut brown with
  ruby lights and a tan cream top. Taste is medium bitter to light sweet but the smoky
  quality sustained the bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a long finish. A good example of smoked porter to set against the
  commoner fruit varieties.
