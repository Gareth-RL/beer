BeerID: 20707
Brewer: Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.)
City: Oakham
Comments: Cask. Aroma caramel malt with bread undertones. Pour copper with white top.
  Taste biscuit malts wih some hoppiness in the savour. But something is clearly lacking.
  For me the balance goes as it dwells on the palate with a bitter aftertaste that
  needs some contrast.
