Comments: '"Aroma of tropical fruit notably passion-fruit and pineapple with some
  dank pine behind. Poured a decidedly murky orange pale body with whit foam top.
  Taste is New England style soft fruitiness with sweetness dominant before a fluctuating
  transition to a final pine resinous bittersweet finish. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky clammmy feel with soft carbonation and a long fruit to pine finish. For me
  it was more NEIPA than IPA. Let''s see if the Strata hop is the thing for this year."'
