Comments: '"Poured dark chocolate almost black with decent tan cream head diminishing
  to loose lacing. Emphatic scent of chocolate with lactose and vanilla accentuating
  the milky qualities. It smells like a milkshake. Unsurprisingly, the taste is medium
  sweet to full with a pleasant cocoa spine that adds a darker bitter note (thank
  goodness) The vanilla is still evident too, but it doesn''t push the beer beyond
  tolerance in my view. Texture is full bodied and creamy where the lactose is clearly
  a factor. Carbonation is soft to average, and counteracts what might otherwise be
  a clammy feel. The finish is bitter chocolate. This is certainly a beer that lives
  up to its name. I suspect some milk stout purists might dispute its complexity but
  it certainly was a pleasure to sup."'
