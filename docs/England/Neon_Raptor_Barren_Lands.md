| **Comments** | Aroma has tropical fruit hops. Pours cloudy golden body with white lace top in the New England style. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a smooth transition and a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Session worthy. And heavily hopped considering the abv. |
