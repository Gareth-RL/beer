| **Comments** | Cask. Served to me on the mild trail and called a golden mild but I wonder. The aroma was fruity and floral with the dark side of the spectrum very lightly hinted indeed. Taste was medium sweet with a soft bitter finish. If this is mild then it has evolved far from the drink I know. But I certainly agree with CR that it is understated.  |
