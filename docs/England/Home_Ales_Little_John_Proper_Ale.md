| **Comments** | Cask. Pours bright amber copper with white lace top. Hop fruits predominate in the aroma. Taste has berry fruit and biscuit malt. A well balanced bitter tried during tap takeover at the Hop Merchant in a deserted and very windy city centre. Second sipping. 22/10/19  still balanced like a wrestling match between hop and malts and some injury to each. |
