Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky gold with fleeting thin lace.
  Aroma is fruity with peach melon and lime lurking. Taste is medium sweet to sour
  with a chalky bitter end. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation,
  and the said finish. I&#39;ve tasted better "'
