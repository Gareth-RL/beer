| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky gold with fleeting thin lace. Aroma is fruity with peach melon and lime lurking. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a chalky bitter end. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and the said finish. I&#39;ve tasted better  |
