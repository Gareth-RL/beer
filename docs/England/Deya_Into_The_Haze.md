| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy pale-yellow with white froth. Aroma is tropical fruit pineapples grapefruit papaya. Taste is juicy sweet with peach and a light bitter finish. Palate is medium + in terms of body, sticky texture, average to lively carbonation, and a modest bitter tang. A fruit juice of a beer. |
