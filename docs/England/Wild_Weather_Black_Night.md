Brewer: Wild Weather Ales
City: Aldermaston Stoke
Comments: Cask. Pours dark amber with ruby lights and thick off-white top. Aroma has
  caramelized malts and and hop fruits. Taste is medium sweet with abiding stone fruits
  flavours. A slight sour tang in the finish. Carbonation is flat. A decent mild that
  gets good results for a low abv.
