Comments: '"Cask. Modestly toffee nosed. Pours dark chestnut with lasting tan top.
  Taste is medium sweet malts with medium body and a soft finish. There is some languor
  but no surprises. The sweetness dims to sour. Once this type of beer sufficed but
  increasingly expectations rise, except perhaps among the lager drinkers who meander
  from Carling to Kronenbourg with the excitement of Tuborg and Carlsberg to divert
  them. And some of them vote with similar discernment &#40;forgive the sour grapes&#41;."'
