| **Comments** | Cask. Modestly toffee nosed. Pours dark chestnut with lasting tan top. Taste is medium sweet malts with medium body and a soft finish. There is some languor but no surprises. The sweetness dims to sour. Once this type of beer sufficed but increasingly expectations rise, except perhaps among the lager drinkers who meander from Carling to Kronenbourg with the excitement of Tuborg and Carlsberg to divert them. And some of them vote with similar discernment &#40;forgive the sour grapes&#41;. |
