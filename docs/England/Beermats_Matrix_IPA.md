Comments: Poured golden body thin lace top. Light aroma of citrus hops and pale malt.
  Medium sweet to bitter, smooth transition from fruity start to bitter finish with
  a long bitter finish. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Pretty standard stuff but solid enough.
