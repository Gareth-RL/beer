| **Comments** | Bottle from Adventure Beers. Poured clear golden body full white foam top. Aroma of pale bread malts and light citrus grassy hops. Lightly sweet to bitter with a crisp finish in the classic lager style. As the label says ' bright and easy going' or should that be easy drinking. Light body, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a crisp finish. If only it had arrived yesterday, I could have shared it with my friend Helmut from Koln. For my part, it's a lager. And that's the most I can say. |
