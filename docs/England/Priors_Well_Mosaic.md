| **Comments** | Cask. Pours clear very golden with white top and the aroma is skunky, heading towards cat. I suspect it is a bitter and I was misled by the colour and the choice of hop. However the taste is classic English bitter for all those who like a twiggy finish and a sticky texture then seek it out. |
