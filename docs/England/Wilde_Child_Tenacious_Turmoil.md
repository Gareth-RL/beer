Beer: Wilde Child Tenacious Turmoil

Brewer: Wilde Child Brewing Co
City: Leeds
Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body tan cream top. Aroma of toffee malt
  rather than treacle. Medium sweet to bitter with a definite toffee treacle note
  but thankfully not over powering. Medium sweet slightly sticky texture as befits
  a treacle stout, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Compared to the peanut
  butter stout I had earlier this one works .
