| **Comments** | Cask. Scent sour musty yeasty. Pours pale amber white top. Taste soft fruits and bread malts. Slightly resinous finish. It’s not clear what this is aiming for. It is neither an easy drinking session bitter nor an ESB. Tastes like a blonde gone wrong &#40;and not as good as that may sound to some.&#41; |
