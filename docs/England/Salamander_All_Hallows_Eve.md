Comments: '"Cask. Scent sour musty yeasty. Pours pale amber white top. Taste soft
  fruits and bread malts. Slightly resinous finish. It’s not clear what this is aiming
  for. It is neither an easy drinking session bitter nor an ESB. Tastes like a blonde
  gone wrong &#40;and not as good as that may sound to some.&#41;"'
