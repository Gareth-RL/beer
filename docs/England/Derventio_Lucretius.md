| **Comments** | Cask. Dark with coffee froth. The aroma is the thing for this beer - pungently sweet vanilla and cherries like a marshmallow. Unless you are a kriek fan already you will approach the taste with trepidation and it’s certainly a sweet beer with the possibility that it was brewed in a sweets jar. But it’s not overwhelming. In fact it seems light for a stout with a 5 5%abv. That said I’ll take a half next time&#033; |
