Beer: Lenton Lane Twist & Stout
BeerID: 908768
Brewer: Lenton Lane Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Bottle. Pours dark brown almost black body with tan lace top. Aroma of dark
  malts, some coffee, some liquorice, some molasses. Taste is lightly sweet to medium
  bitter with a salted caramel tang. They recommend serving it cool and I may have
  chilled it a tad too far so it is going to sit for a while before a second sip.
  Well, it is certainly more a bitter or dry stout than a milk one. Medium bodied,
  with a smooth silky consistency, average carbonation in the bottle, and a definite
  bitter liquorice finish. I heartily approve.
