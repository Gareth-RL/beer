BeerID: 143941
Brewer: Black Hole Brewery
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with tan cream head like a tall expresso. Aroma of roasted
  malts. The smoky malty taste is melded to some sweetness and the creamy wash gives
  a pleasantly soft low carbonation finish. Overall a good medium bodied stout.
