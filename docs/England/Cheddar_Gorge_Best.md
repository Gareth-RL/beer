| **Comments** | Poured clear copper body with slightly broken white lace. No great scent by bread malts overpower a hint of dry fruits. Taste is classic bitter by which I mean old fashioned rather than cherished. Biscuit bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation smooth enough and said finish which Proust like stirs memories of 1970s pubs. The most pleasing thing might be that it adds to my meagre Somerset beer total. |
