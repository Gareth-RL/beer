| **Comments** | Cask. Rich chocolate and roasted malts. Pours mahogany dark with full cream tan head. Tastes sweet fruits to the fore,, milk chocolate and smooth soft texture that belies its 5%. I can imagine an evening of these but may equally readily forget them. 25/05/24 second sipping on the Mild Trail 2024 |
