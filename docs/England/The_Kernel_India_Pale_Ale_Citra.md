Beer: The Kernel India Pale Ale Citra
BeerID: 137414
Brewer: The Kernel Brewery
City: Bermondsey
Comments: Bottle. Pours slightly cloudy pale amber with white head. Aroma is decidedly
  citrusy--mandarin and grapefruit scent. Taste is medium sweet souring to bitter
  with more pronounced grapefruit and piney notes. Palate is medium bodied, strong
  transition, with some lasting sourness despite average to more carbonation. The
  balance is maintained well. I still doubt the single hop but this is good.
