| **Comments**  | It's not easy to brew a stellar bitter and this proves it. Poured copper brown body thin lace top.  Aroma of lightly roasted malts and berry hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with balance rather than distinction.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a twiggy bitter finish. In some ways classic and in others forgettable. This is probably harsh, but IMO true.                                                                                      |
