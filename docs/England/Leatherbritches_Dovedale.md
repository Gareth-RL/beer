Comments: '"It''s not easy to brew a stellar bitter and this proves it. Poured copper
  brown body thin lace top.  Aroma of lightly roasted malts and berry hops.  Medium
  sweet to bitter with balance rather than distinction.  Medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a twiggy bitter finish. In some ways classic and in others
  forgettable. This is probably harsh, but IMO true."'
