| **Comments** | Cask. No overpowering aroma although a hint of cherry is there. Reddish brown, tan head. The cherries are more evident in the taste which has soft chocolate undertones. Light on the palate with definite carbonation - or is it just JW cellarage. A modest entry in a stellar field of fruity porters |
