Comments: Aroma has herbal grassy hop quality. Pours hazy golden brown body with white
  lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter easy gently spiced transition. Palate
  is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. What
  do you demand in a session ipa? Consistency sure complexity if you are lucky. Easy
  drinking. My answer is in the 11/20 overall score.
