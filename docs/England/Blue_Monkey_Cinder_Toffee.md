Comments: 'Poured black body deep tan cream lace. Definitely aroma of cinder toffee
  a liquid Crunchie. Taste is medium sweet and that persists in a peanut butter brittle
  kind of way. Palate medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a cloying
  finish - points deducted but it is what it says.  05/07/23 Odd to see it in July.
  Still waiting for Crunchie fans 06/14/24 a summer special. '
