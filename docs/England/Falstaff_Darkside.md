| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of plums with chocolate notes. Pours dark coffee with thin white swirl top. Taste flat malt biscuit with faint sweet chocolate in the background. No great body and slight fruity tang to finish. Despite the name Iâ€™m not over the moon for this one. Second sipping 18/10/21 Taste has improved. Still watery. I got me into orbit briefly. |
