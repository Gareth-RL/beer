Brewer: Falstaff Brewery
City: Derby
Comments: Cask. Aroma of plums with chocolate notes. Pours dark coffee with thin white
  swirl top. Taste flat malt biscuit with faint sweet chocolate in the background.
  No great body and slight fruity tang to finish. Despite the name I’m not over the
  moon for this one. Second sipping 18/10/21 Taste has improved. Still watery. I got
  me into orbit briefly.
