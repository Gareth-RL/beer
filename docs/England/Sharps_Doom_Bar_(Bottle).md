| **Comments** | Has it come to this? I generally avoid this in any pub with an alternative but this was a gift and I hoped the bottle might differ from the cask. Aroma is lightly malted with maybe a hint of sweet hop. Poured amber body with a diminishing lace head. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with an easy transition and a lingering duration. Palate is medium too with average carbonation and a drying finish. Okay I guess |
