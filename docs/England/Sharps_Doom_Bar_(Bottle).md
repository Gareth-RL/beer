Comments: Has it come to this? I generally avoid this in any pub with an alternative
  but this was a gift and I hoped the bottle might differ from the cask. Aroma is
  lightly malted with maybe a hint of sweet hop. Poured amber body with a diminishing
  lace head. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with an easy transition and a lingering
  duration. Palate is medium too with average carbonation and a drying finish. Okay
  I guess
