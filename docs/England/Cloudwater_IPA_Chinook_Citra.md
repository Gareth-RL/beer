| **Comments** | Keg at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma is muted tropical hop but not as strong as I expected. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a refreshing juiciness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a sour finish. Nothing special. |
