Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Keg at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white lace
  top. Aroma is muted tropical hop but not as strong as I expected. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly sour with a refreshing juiciness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky
  texture, average carbonation, and a sour finish. Nothing special.
