| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. But apparently widely available bottled. On tap, the aroma is less pungent I expect since for me the fruity notes and pale malts were decidedly muted. More evident in the mouth. Pours hazy pale orange as per NEIPA requirements. Although less murky than many. Taste is fruity and thereby sweet to bitter all along a medium range. Palate is good medium bodied plus, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a soft bitter finish &#40;the opposite of crisp&#41;. Overall a decent pale that illustrates the nerdiness of dry hopping. |
