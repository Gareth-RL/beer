Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. But apparently widely available bottled.
  On tap, the aroma is less pungent I expect since for me the fruity notes and pale
  malts were decidedly muted. More evident in the mouth. Pours hazy pale orange as
  per NEIPA requirements. Although less murky than many. Taste is fruity and thereby
  sweet to bitter all along a medium range. Palate is good medium bodied plus, sticky
  texture, soft carbonation, and a soft bitter finish &#40;the opposite of crisp&#41;.
  Overall a decent pale that illustrates the nerdiness of dry hopping."'
