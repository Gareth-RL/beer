| **Comments** | Poured cola black with no head to speak of. Aroma is of dark stone fruits, nuts and molasses with a  definite booziness. Taste is medium sweet with some coffee and chocolate notes, again some dark fruitiness to the fore and a little treacly licorice at the back. Palate is medium to full bodied, sticky texture soft to average carbonation and a long finish. Overall an agreeable winter warmer and tasty enough for a wet spring afternoon. |
