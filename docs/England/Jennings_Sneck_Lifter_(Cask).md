Beer: Jennings Sneck Lifter (Cask)
BeerID: 47619
Brewer: '"Jennings Brewery (Carlsberg Marston&#39;s Brewing Co.)"'
City: Cockermouth
Comments: Cask. Dark chestnut with white top. Aroma of biscuit malts. Taste of caramel,
  syrup and dark fruit, dates, prunes. Full bodied with a lasting coat to the palate.
  This used to be a rare treat in my Lancastrian youth when real ale was scarce and
  it still pleases even if it is less exceptional. All I lacks is a winter night and
  an open fire.
