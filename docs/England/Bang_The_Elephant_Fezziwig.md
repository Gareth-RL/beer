| **Comments** | Aroma of spice and dark malt. Pours chestnut with tan top. Taste is medium bitter with light spice notes (the chai is not too intrusive). Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a spicy finish. Advertised as a winter warmer and certainly this is the weather for it. But I can't say it convinced me that chai was what beer had been missing. |
