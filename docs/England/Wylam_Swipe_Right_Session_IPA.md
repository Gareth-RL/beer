Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Wylam Swipe Right Session IPA
BeerID: 515148
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange golden body and white lace top. Aroma
  has pithy citrus hops and pale malts. Taste is medium bitter with a fruity tang.
  Palate is interesting with a fuller texture than its medium body would imply. Carbonation
  is average to soft. Finish is long and grapefruit. Overall a session IPA that I
  could stick with.
