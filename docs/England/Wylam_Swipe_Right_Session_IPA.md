| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange golden body and white lace top. Aroma has pithy citrus hops and pale malts. Taste is medium bitter with a fruity tang. Palate is interesting with a fuller texture than its medium body would imply. Carbonation is average to soft. Finish is long and grapefruit. Overall a session IPA that I could stick with. |
