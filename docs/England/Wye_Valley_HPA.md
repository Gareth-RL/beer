| **Comments** | Poured golden body with white lace top. Light aroma of pale malts and grassy hop. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a citrus finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish but with a light fruit twist. Still looking for a standout Herefordshire beer. |
