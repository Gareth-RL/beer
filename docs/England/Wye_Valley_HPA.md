Comments: Poured golden body with white lace top. Light aroma of pale malts and grassy
  hop. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a citrus finish. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish but with a light fruit
  twist. Still looking for a standout Herefordshire beer.
