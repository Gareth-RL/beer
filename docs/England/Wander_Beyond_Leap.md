Comments: '"Strong chocolate cocoa powder scent. Pours black with tan halo. Taste
  is chocolate cake soaked in spirit with a hint of cherry as we head to black forest
  territory. Palate is medium to full bodied, average carbonation, certainly not soft,
  and for me this fuzzed the finish. But I didn''t miss the gluten."'
