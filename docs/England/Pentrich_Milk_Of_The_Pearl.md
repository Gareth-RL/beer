| **Comments**  | Can from Adventure beers. Poured dark brown almost black body, thin tan lacing. Aroma has coffee and roasted malts but just a hint of vanilla. Taste is medium sweet thanks to the lactose and vanilla but there is an odd fruit combo in there as well. No great transition just a fade. Light to medium body, watery feel, and a decided odd finish. Something amiss                                                                                      |
