Brewer: Pentrich Brewing Co.
City: Pentrich
Comments: Can from Adventure beers. Poured dark brown almost black body, thin tan
  lacing. Aroma has coffee and roasted malts but just a hint of vanilla. Taste is
  medium sweet thanks to the lactose and vanilla but there is an odd fruit combo in
  there as well. No great transition just a fade. Light to medium body, watery feel,
  and a decided odd finish. Something amiss
