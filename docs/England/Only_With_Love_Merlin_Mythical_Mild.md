| **Comments**  | Poured rich chestnut brown body off white lace. Aroma of chocolate malt. Medium sweet to bitter with malt still outperforming hops. But plenty of flavour for the abv. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A better than average Mild                                                                                      |
