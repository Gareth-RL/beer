Brewer: Partizan Brewing
City: Market Harborough
Comments: Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with white lace halo.
  Aroma has strawberry milkshake notes. Taste carries the basil as it shifts from
  medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to fizzy
  carbonation and a medicinal bitter herbal finish. Overall it overcomes some Saison
  weaknesses in terms of body and complexity but it seems to head in contrasting directors
  - aromatic sweetness and medicinal taste. Interesting rather than endearing.
