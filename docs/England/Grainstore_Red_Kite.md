Beer: Grainstore Red Kite
BeerID: 267609
Brewer: Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.)
City: Oakham
Comments: Pours amber with thick white head. Aroma bready and resiny. Taste is more
  sweet than bitter and it may be better with less chilled cellarage. Palate is heavy
  due to carbonation but overall it has neither a strong full flavour nor a telling
  linger on the tongue. I will not fly this kite again.
