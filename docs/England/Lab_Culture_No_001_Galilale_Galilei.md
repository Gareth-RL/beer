| **Comments** | Aroma resinous pine and fruit. Pours hazy brown golden body with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite rich caramel and resinous note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. I wonder if Galileo was a beer drinker at all or did he stick to il vino? |
