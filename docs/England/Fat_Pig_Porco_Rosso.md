| **Comments** | Brewed for the Leicester Beer Festival using very heavy peat smoked malt. Predictably therefore this is what comes through on the malty nose. It is a ruby amber colour with a thin top. The taste has dark fruits and beneath the smoke there is a sweet languor although it remains light to medium on the palate. |
