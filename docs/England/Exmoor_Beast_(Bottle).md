Beer: Exmoor Beast (Bottle)
BeerID: 70258
Brewer: Exmoor Ales
City: Wiveliscombe
Comments: Bottle, Poured dark brown with foam tan lacing. Aroma is caramel malts,
  nicely toffeed. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a fairly swift transition to
  licorice and aniseed flavours in the second half. Palate is medium bodied, smooth
  texture, average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Certainly the toffee scent
  led me to expect a sweeter beer, but the bite of the beast is agreeable enough.
