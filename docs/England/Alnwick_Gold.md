Brewer: Alnwick Brewery (Harry Hotspur Holdings)
City: Alnwick
Comments: We were in Alnmouth after visiting Alnwick suit seemed the right beer to
  have.  Aroma is grassy herbal hop and pale malts. Pours clear golden with lasting
  white lace. Taste is medium sweet to sour then bitter in the finish with a lemony
  note. Palate is thin to medium bodied with a watery feel soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. The town is more appealing.
