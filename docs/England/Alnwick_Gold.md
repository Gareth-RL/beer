| **Comments** | We were in Alnmouth after visiting Alnwick suit seemed the right beer to have.  Aroma is grassy herbal hop and pale malts. Pours clear golden with lasting white lace. Taste is medium sweet to sour then bitter in the finish with a lemony note. Palate is thin to medium bodied with a watery feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. The town is more appealing. |
