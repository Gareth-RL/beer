| **Comments** | Aroma is richly citrus with pale malt below. Pours murky orange brown with thin lace top. Taste is lightly sweet but increasingly sour and bitter with the latter pronounced in the finish. Palate is medium is bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long bitter finish. A decent IPA |
