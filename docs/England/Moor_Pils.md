| **Comments** | poured a pale yellow gold body with thin diminishing lacing. Aroma has a little grassy hop and pale malts. Taste is lightly sweet with a medium grainy grassy bitterness to follow. Palate is light to medium bodied, average carbonation, husky feel in the mouth and a soft finish. Another lager that I can drink without a grimace. |
