BeerID: 261798
Brewer: Dukeries Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: Cas. Malty nose. Roasted, toasted, caramelized (you name it). pours dark
  mahogany brown, pale creamy top. Tastes predictably of caramel malts, with dates
  and hints of cough mixture. Long lasting on the palate with a slight oily quality
  and the fruit notes pick up on the second swallow. Overall, fine but an odd mix.
  30/07/24 second sipping after 8 years. Malty nose now has a nutty coffee scent;
  could be the malt but more likely the nose. Taste still has cough mixture quality
  but it is muted by the coffee note. Still a decent dark ale.
