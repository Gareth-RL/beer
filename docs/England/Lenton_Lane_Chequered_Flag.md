| **Comments** | Aroma has roasted malts and some berry hops. Pours dark brown with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light licorice note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall decent if standard fare in a crowded market. Not sure it's a winner.  |
