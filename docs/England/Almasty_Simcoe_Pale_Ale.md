| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma orangina. Pours slightly hazy yellow gold with thin white lace. Taste is medium sweet then sour and a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied soft to average carbonation, oily texture, and astringent finish. Far from their best. But I have drunk many acask ale that was fuller than this. |
