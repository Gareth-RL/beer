| **Comments** | You either like your plum porter plummy or you don't. The Grand Reserve seems to favour the plum addicts. Aroma has stewed plum. Pours dark with a tan top but held to the light there is a plum tint.  Taste is medium sweet to sour along a plum line. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a long finish. Fruity but a symphony on a single note. I was once told the workers hate it for the stench it produces while fermenting. Less plum than bum. |
