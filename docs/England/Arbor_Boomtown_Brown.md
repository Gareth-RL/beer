| **Comments** | Tap. A lively third. It took four attempts to fill with modest froth. Strong peach and grapefruit aroma. Taste has toffee malt but buried beneath the hop fruits with grapefruit overpowering all contenders. This makes it an American rather British brown ale and hence you can charge more for it. But worth it. |
