| **Comments** | Poured deep red chestnut body with lasting tan cream top. Aroma of dark malt some coffee some chocolate. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with berry fruits and more coffee malts and a hint of licorice. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A very decent stout  |
