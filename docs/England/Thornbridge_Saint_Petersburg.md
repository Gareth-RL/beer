| **Comments** | tap at the Derby Winter Beer festival. A bold way to start given the abv but it had just won best stout in the festival. Caramel and molasses aroma. Pours dark mahogany with broken lace. Taste has licorice notes and chocolate in the back ground in a satisfying malty stout. One can see why it is a winner |
