Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught. Pours light amber gold body white lace top. Aroma
  has mango and mandarin orange with some pale malt lurking in a suspect fashion.
  Taste is medium bitter with a sourness like ill judged marmalade. Palate is medium
  bodied, texture is sticky, carbonation average to fizzy, and the finish is a souring
  belch. I can&#39;t imagine a session of this &#40;well not since I went to the psychiatrist&#41;.
  And yet it is like a badly played concerto - it&#39;s more than I could manage but
  less than I will seek."'
