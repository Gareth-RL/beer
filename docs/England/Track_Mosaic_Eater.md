Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow with off white lacing.
  Aroma has lime and floral notes modestly and grassy notes. Taste is medium sweet
  to sour bitterness with a quite acerbic finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky
  texture, and astringent, finish. Not sure I would want a session of this.
