| **Comments** | Cask at the Doctor&#39;s Orders micropub. Pours dark chestnut off white lacing.. Aroma has roasted caramelized malts and some berry hop. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Once all mild was Ike this. |
