| **Comments** | Tap. . Light citrus. Pale yellow. Over carbonation. Yellow gold. Medium sweet bitter finish with buttery notes. Meh. 11/24/17 Tap. Pours pale hazy orange with thin scummy top. Aroma is light orange and lemon floral notes. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to lively carbonation (more than it needs). Finish is despondent and the final remark remains true. 16/09/23 third mistake  |
