Comments: '"Can. I really don''t know how the NR guys do it. Generally I do not seek
  out purple beer nor beer with the word elderberry in the recipe. Even the title
  Who paid for that floor? is vaguely ominous. (I poured carefully). Anyway it is
  purple, not clear and any head it had left quicker than Ann Boleyn''s.  There is
  a definite fruitiness to the bouquet, but it seems positively modest compared to
  the fruitiness in the taste. I am not a connoisseur of the elderberry but it seems
  there in a berry tart kind of way, I am a fan of the blood orange, although generally
  at times of the day when beer is not the normal option. Anyway, let it be noted
  that it is medium sweet to sour. Palate wise, hmmn. It''s odd, initially light to
  medium but finishes medium to full (there''s a trick). Carbonation soft but still
  evident, and like no milkshake I have ever had. Overall, this belongs firmly in
  the category of beers than my grandfather would have not called beer. But hey, I
  liked it. "'
