| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours like a fruit cocktail campari style. Passionfruit, raspberry, light grapefruit. Aroma is fruity and sweet in the pastille style &#40;it&#39;s beer Jim, but not as we know it.&#41; Taste is lightly sweet and lightly sour with the spice helping the latter. Texture is also light, slightly oily feel, flat carbonation, and a soft finish. It&#39;s a completely painless way to ingest alcohol, but not mine. |
