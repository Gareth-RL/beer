| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has butterscotch malt and cereal notes. Pours amber darker than a typical IPA. White lace top. The vanilla notes give the taste a strong initial sweetness but a medium bitterness emerges with a sour finish. Carbonation is soft and the finish is oily and long. A flavorful beer but could I take a session of it? &#40;no&#41;. |
