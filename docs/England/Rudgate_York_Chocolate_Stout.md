| **Comments** | Cask at The Crown Inn Beeston. Pours a dark chestnut with tan top. Aroma has dark chocolate malt front and centre. But what follow is less impressive. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but not especially rich on the chocolate side. Palate is watery for a stout, average carbonation, and a bitter finish but disappointing in the mouth compared to the other senses. |
