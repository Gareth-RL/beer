Beer: Totally Brewed Experimental Series Double Dry-hopped Vol 1
BeerID: 594134
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught. Given that this is the new TB tap house in town
  there should be more info about their beers especially new brews. Pours slightly
  hazy pale gold with broken white lace top. Aroma has earthy herbal notes that suggests
  Simcoe but there are fruit and floral hints that imply other hops. Palate is dry,
  medium to light body, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, and a crisp bitter
  finish. Taste is medium bitter to light sour crispness. I have not drunk enough
  English pale to judge the experiment but certainly I have drunk worse beer.
