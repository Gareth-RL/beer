Comments: '"Cask at Halloween beer festival Hand & Heart. Pours pale golden white
  lace top. Broken lacing. Aroma has biscuit malt and hop berry fruits. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with a definite bitter finish. This blonde is more bitter than the
  last bitter I tried. The brewer likes blondes and for Halloween has slipped one
  in between his Naughty and Platinum varieties. All fall within the broad and valuable
  category of session ale that it&#39;s easy to be snobbish about. But surely festival
  beer should be special rather than close to the standard fare?"'
