| **Comments** | Cask at Halloween beer festival Hand & Heart. Pours pale golden white lace top. Broken lacing. Aroma has biscuit malt and hop berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite bitter finish. This blonde is more bitter than the last bitter I tried. The brewer likes blondes and for Halloween has slipped one in between his Naughty and Platinum varieties. All fall within the broad and valuable category of session ale that it&#39;s easy to be snobbish about. But surely festival beer should be special rather than close to the standard fare? |
