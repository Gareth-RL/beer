Comments: Pouthazy pink reddish body halo lacing. Aroma has almond and Tonka bean once you get past the cherries. Medium sweet to sour bitter. Once more the cherry army holds the fort before lemon zest let's Tonka in the back door. Light to medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and sour finish.  It falls into the vast category of contemporary craft ale that tastes fine but prompts the question Is it beer?
