Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy pale orange with thin lace.
  Aroma was muted for me, but some citrus and melon evident. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly sour and bitter. But if you like it then it may well be for the palate.
  It&#39;s chewable. So palate is medium bodied plus, orange pulp texture, soft to
  average carbonation and after a sour phase the finish is bitter. As I have written
  my overall grade has gone up even while I can defend the lower aroma mark and feel
  comfortable with the rest. It&#39;s a coalition beer not an integrated entity."'
