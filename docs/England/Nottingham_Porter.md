Comments: Poured ruby chestnut body cream tan lace top. Aroma of roasted malts with background toffee. Medium sweet to lightly bitter. Malt dominant with a coffee tang. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. A robust porter 5/08/24 second sipping.  Decent enough
