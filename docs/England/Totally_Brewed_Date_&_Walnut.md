Beer: Totally Brewed Date & Walnut
BeerID: 711435
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has dates and dark roasted malts and earthy notes. Pours dark chestnut
  with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and maybe just, (allowing
  for the placebo effect) nutty. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a light sweet finish. I liked it and even if it were not the stout and porter
  stroll currently, I might drink it.
