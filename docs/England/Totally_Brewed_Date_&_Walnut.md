| **Comments** | Aroma has dates and dark roasted malts and earthy notes. Pours dark chestnut with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and maybe just, (allowing for the placebo effect) nutty. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light sweet finish. I liked it and even if it were not the stout and porter stroll currently, I might drink it. |
