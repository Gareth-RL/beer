Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company

Comments: Bottle from Adventure. Pours dark chestnut rapidly dissipating off-white
  head. Aroma has some caramelized malt notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some
  caramel some chocolate; not much salt until the finish which is still bitter. Palate
  is thin to medium, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Considering
  the pastry stouts out there, this is under-stated to say the least
