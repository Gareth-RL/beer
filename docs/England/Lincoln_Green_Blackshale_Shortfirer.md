Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: I think this must be Black Shale Shot Shooter. Pours the unexpected pale
  gold with white lace of a white stout. Aroma has sour malts and soft fruits. Taste
  is medium bitter to sour. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average and sour
  finish. Not impressed.
