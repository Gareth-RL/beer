Beer: North Riding Mocha Porter
BeerID: 488177
Brewer: North Riding Brewery
City: Snainton
Comments: Cask. Pours dark mahogany with thin bubbly top. Aroma is molasses coffee
  and licorice.. The taste lives up to its name with chocolate and coffee notes ahead
  of malts and a growing bitterness on the palate. I seem to be the first non-Scandinavian
  reviewer and I liked it a lot more. Good of its type which is not a type one would
  drink n volume.
