| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours clear amber gold with white lace top. Aroma has melon citrus hops and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with more grainy qualities than a lager. Palate is thus medium bodied but rough texture average carbonation and a rich slightly sweet finish. I guess IPL stands for a. Lager I might like &#40;in code of course&#41;. |
