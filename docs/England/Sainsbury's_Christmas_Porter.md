| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours dark body tan cream top. Aroma of dark fruits and chocolate malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with spicy seasonal notes. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. It certainly belongs to the annual experiment to create a brew with a seasonal flavour. With most, including this, the question is whether the flavours added improve the beer. I enjoy a dark porter with stone fruits and chocolate flavours, but whether nutmeg or cinnamon enhance that is debateable. |
