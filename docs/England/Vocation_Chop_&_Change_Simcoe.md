Comments: 'Posted golden body white lace top. Aroma grapefruit melon and apricot.
  Taste medium sweet to bitter with plenty of tropical fruit and a pale malt spine.
  Palate medium to light bodied, some graininess, average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish. Not a big fan of single hop beers but this is better than most '
