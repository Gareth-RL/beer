| **Comments** | Posted golden body white lace top. Aroma grapefruit melon and apricot. Taste medium sweet to bitter with plenty of tropical fruit and a pale malt spine. Palate medium to light bodied, some graininess, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Not a big fan of single hop beers but this is better than most  |
