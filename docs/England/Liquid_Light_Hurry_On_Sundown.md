Comments: Cocoa nibs and coffee as befits a mocha porter.  Poured black bodied with
  thin tan lace diminishing.  Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a hint
  of licorice. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. Eminently drinkable (so I drank it). 27/02/20 second sipping. Still eminent.
