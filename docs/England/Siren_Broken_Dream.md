Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Aroma is relatively muted, dark malts coffee cocoa, light toffee. Pours
  black body with tan cream top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a full mouthful
  of latte coffee initially. Palate is medium to full, creamy feel, soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. A smooth stout that develops in the tasting in terms of bitterness
  and texture. 18/07/20 second sipping. Can at home. Malty aroma with smoke and coffee
  as promised Chocolate in the taste. No tan top this time but the creamy feel remains
  as does the bitter finish. I might mark it lower on taste and overall, but that
  might be more indicative of my mood than of the beer!
