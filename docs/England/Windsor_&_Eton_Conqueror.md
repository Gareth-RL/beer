Beer: Windsor & Eton Conqueror
BeerID: 133203
Brewer: Windsor & Eton Brewery
City: Windsor
Comments: Cask. Aroma malty and straw. Pours dark bubbly top broken lace diminishing.
  Tastes caramel bitter chocolate and hoppy afters. Reasonably balanced but thereby
  less memorable. 08/06/24 second sipping 8 years later nearly.  The straw scent has
  turned to earth. Still decent chocolate and caramel malt and still unable to describe
  the lager hops. But worth more points in my generous old age
