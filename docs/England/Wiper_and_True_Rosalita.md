| **Comments** | Aroma has berry fruit and cereal grains. Pours copper clear body thin off white lace. Taste is medium sweet with light bitterness and some sour grain notes. Palate is  thin to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long finish. I have still to find a red ale that is mine.  |
