| **Comments** | Cask. Pours chestnut brown with white lace top. Some toffee malt and stewed fruit on the nose. Tastes more bitter and hoppy than the scent suggests. More roasted cereal notes than raisin on the tongue to my mind. But given that the last three beers I rated were bland and forgettable, this is an improvement. It’s a medium bodied bitter with a strong lasting bitterness on the palate and there’s a place for that. Although it’s shrinking. |
