Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: 'Gadds No 3 '
BeerID: 25556
Brewer: Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds)
City: Broadstairs
Comments: Cask at the Roebuck. Pours light amber frothy white top. Aroma has roasted
  malts, fruity hops, and some banana yeast. Taste is medium bitter heading towards
  the wood. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation despite a lively
  initial pour. Finish is bitter. Chosen to show loyalty to the bitter brand in a
  world of blonde and pale ales. Fine but not great.
