| **Comments** | Cask at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Setting aside the way my modest dislike of Alan Shearer has grown exponentially with his punditry, this is a mysterious brew. Yes certainly more Schwartz bier than porter. Aroma has roasted malts to the fore. Pours dark amber with off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.although the sweetness lingers. Palate is is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation and a soft slightly sweet finish so no lager crisp finish. But at 3.9% it punches way above its weight in terms of taste and complexity  |
