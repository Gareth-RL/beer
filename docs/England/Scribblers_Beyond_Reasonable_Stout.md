| **Comments** | Cask. Pours a dark mahogany with thin bubbly tan top. Aroma lozenges and malt. Tastes of licorice, plum and cough syrup but in a good way&#033; Medium bodied and rich with lots of flavours to savour. Certainly a porter to carry home. And one that would taste even better as winter kicks in. |
