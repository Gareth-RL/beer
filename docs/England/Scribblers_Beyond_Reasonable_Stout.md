Comments: '"Cask. Pours a dark mahogany with thin bubbly tan top. Aroma lozenges and
  malt. Tastes of licorice, plum and cough syrup but in a good way&#033; Medium bodied
  and rich with lots of flavours to savour. Certainly a porter to carry home. And
  one that would taste even better as winter kicks in."'
