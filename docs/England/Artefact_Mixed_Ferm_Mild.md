Comments: 'Aroma of berries and coffee malts. Poured reddish brown with a rapidly
  fading tan top. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a plummy note for me. Palate
  is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation, and the sour finish.
  Thus not the usual Mild and certainly not a sour. '
