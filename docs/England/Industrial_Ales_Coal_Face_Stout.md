Comments: '"Poured ruby chestnut body with thin off white lace top. Aroma is roasted
  malts bready with light hop notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with predominantly
  roasted malt flavour. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and
  a bitter finish, which lingers. All fair enough, but does anyone,who doesn''t have
  to, return to the coal face?"'
