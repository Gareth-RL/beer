Beer: Left Handed Giant Nowhere World
BeerID: 652709
Brewer: Left Handed Giant
City: Bristol, St. Philips
Comments: Aroma has chocolate caramel and coconut - oh and booze. Pours black with
  tan top. Tastes like cake, sweetness above medium but it softens. Palate is full
  bodied, rich texture, soft carbonation and a surprisingly light finish booze wise
  given its alcoholic nose. Worthy of a lefty whatever the size.
