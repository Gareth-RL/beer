| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate caramel and coconut - oh and booze. Pours black with tan top. Tastes like cake, sweetness above medium but it softens. Palate is full bodied, rich texture, soft carbonation and a surprisingly light finish booze wise given its alcoholic nose. Worthy of a lefty whatever the size. |
