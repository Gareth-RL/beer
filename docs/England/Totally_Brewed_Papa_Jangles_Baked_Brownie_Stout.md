| **Comments** | Can. Black body tan lace.Cocoa powder on the nose. Lactose. Taste is  medium sweet to bitter with a slightly soured finish.Cocoa notes again citric hops. Palate is thin to medium, slightly drying in the mouth, not normally a Brownie feature. Sour finish. Overall, a disappointment. Papa Jangles is better without additives. |
