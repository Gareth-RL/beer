| **Comments** | Cask at The Organ Grinder Nottingham. Pours golden brown body and thin lace top. Aroma is grassy floral hops. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a strong bitter finish. To me this tasted like a decent bitter so I wonder why it opted for the Golden Blonde category. I have known women who also fit that description, but thankfully too few to recall. |
