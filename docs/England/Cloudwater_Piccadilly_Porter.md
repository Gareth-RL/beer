| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma nutty coffee malts. Medium sweet to bitter with more coffee and a hint of berry. Medium sweet to bitter with a slightly astringent finish. The last detracts for me in a porter. Medium bodied smooth creamy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good rather than great. |
