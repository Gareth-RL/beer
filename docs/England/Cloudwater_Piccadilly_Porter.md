Comments: Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma nutty coffee malts. Medium sweet
  to bitter with more coffee and a hint of berry. Medium sweet to bitter with a slightly
  astringent finish. The last detracts for me in a porter. Medium bodied smooth creamy
  texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good rather than great.
