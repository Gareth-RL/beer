Brewer: Kings Clipstone Brewery
City: Kings Clipstone
Comments: Cask. Aroma malty yeasty. Pours dark amber with thin white top. Taste is
  slightly richer with some sort fruit amidst the malty biscuit. Medium bodied with
  a smooth finish. It’s a bitter that grows in the tasting and is session worthy if
  all else fails.
