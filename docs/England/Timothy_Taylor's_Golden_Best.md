Comments: '"Cask. Pours golden bronze with white frothy top. Some lacing. Aroma muted
  malts with some background fruits. Taste is more fruit with some understated grapefruit
  notes and biscuity malts. It’s well balanced and easy drinking but no one except
  the brewery would call it a mild. So I assume it just fills a niche in their well
  known offerings. 30/4/23 I stumble upon it at 6 year intervals. And it doesn''t
  change "'
