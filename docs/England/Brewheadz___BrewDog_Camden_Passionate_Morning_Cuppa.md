| **Comments** | Tap @ Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours clear yellow gold with tight white lace top. Aroma has hay, herbs, floral, and yep, tea tannins. Taste is medium sour and lightly sweet. Palate light to medium bodied,average carbonation, long finish, but a rather inert one. The bastard child of APA and sour perhaps but if sour, the child is none the less charming. |
