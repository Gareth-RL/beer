| **Comments** | Cask at the Overdraught. Pours hazy pale orange with white lace halo. Aroma has tropical fruits and pale malts. The taste is fruity with a transition from medium sweet to bitter. The palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation and a languorous light to medium bitter finish. Overall the best of their recent efforts. |
