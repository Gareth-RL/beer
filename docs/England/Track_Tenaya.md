| **Comments** | Aroma has a lemon grapefruit zest liveliness. Pours a hazy yellow pale orange with loose lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a spectrum of fruits to cross and a slight fizz in the finish. Palate is light to medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a fruit gum finish. I confess it: it amused me. |
