Comments: '"Bottle at home. Poured black body with tan lace top. Aroma delivers the
  promised honey with some maltbread to spread it on. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with chocolate notes as well. The palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation and a long finish. I really liked it which makes its low average rating
  a bit of a mystery. I guess it''s a marmite rather than a honey beer!"'
