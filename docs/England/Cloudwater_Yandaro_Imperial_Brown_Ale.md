Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours reddish brown with thin lace. Aroma
  has herbs and butterscotch but it works. Taste is medium to full sweet with a little
  bitterness in the background. But sugar is evident. Palate is medium bodied, sticky
  texture, soft to average carbonation, sweet finish. The Imperial Brown is new to
  me but as it edges towards Porter I approve.
