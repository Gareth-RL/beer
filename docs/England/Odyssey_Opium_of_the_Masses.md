| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma has pineapple hop atop cereal notes. Pours the proverbial hazy orange gold with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation and a languorous fruit finish. I suspect I would not spot it in a blind tasting. |
