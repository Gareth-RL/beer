Beer: Odyssey Opium of the Masses
BeerID: 671379
Brewer: Odyssey Brew Co
City: Whitbourne
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Aroma has pineapple hop atop cereal notes.
  Pours the proverbial hazy orange gold with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly bitter and sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft
  carbonation and a languorous fruit finish. I suspect I would not spot it in a blind
  tasting.
