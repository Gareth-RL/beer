Comments: '"Tap. Kuruji is now carrying the subtitle &quot;the Demon Ninja&quot; &#40;maybe
  for Halloween&#41; but it’s the same black IPA at 5.2%. Aroma has pine and grapefruit
  with maybe some chocolate malts for good measure. Pours a muddy mahogany with a
  diminishing bubbly top. They serve the craft ale chilled but I detected red grapefruit
  and more pine. I think this may be a beer that was a transition piece and later
  versions will be better."'
