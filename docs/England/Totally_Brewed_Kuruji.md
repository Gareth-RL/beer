| **Comments** | Tap. Kuruji is now carrying the subtitle &quot;the Demon Ninja&quot; &#40;maybe for Halloween&#41; but itâ€™s the same black IPA at 5.2%. Aroma has pine and grapefruit with maybe some chocolate malts for good measure. Pours a muddy mahogany with a diminishing bubbly top. They serve the craft ale chilled but I detected red grapefruit and more pine. I think this may be a beer that was a transition piece and later versions will be better. |
