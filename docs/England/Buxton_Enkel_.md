| **Comments** | Cask at the Keane&#39;s Head. Pours yellow gold with thin white lace. Aroma is yeasty with banana notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation and a slightly acidic finish. Not a style I know well so its subtleties escape me. |
