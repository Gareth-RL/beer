Comments: '"Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours clear amber brown with off white lace top.
  Aroma has cherry heading towards bubblegum. Taste includes the banana and is medium
  sweet with only the faintest piquancy of sourness at the finish so lets call it
  wild. Palate is light to medium bodied, texture lightly oily, carbonation average,
  and the finish is oblique not languorous or bitter nor astringent and certainly
  abrupt - it&#39;s like an backbeat in music. I enjoyed it."'
