| **Comments** | Poured cloudy golden pale body with white lace top. Aroma of fruited hops tangerine and lime. Taste is medium sweet with sherbet backnote. No clear transition and a muddy finish. Palate is light to medium bodied some mineral grainy notes so despite the lightness it's not the smoothest session IPA. If this were the session beer the conversation would have to excel. 22/11/24 second sipping.  I always like to revisit a harsh judgement if I can. On keg it's clear golden with thin white head.  Aroma as above.  Medium sweet to bitter with an improved but still rapid transition and the murky finish remains for me. But it's better than 3 2 judging by others out there. |
