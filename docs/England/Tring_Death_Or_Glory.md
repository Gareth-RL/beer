| **Comments** | So is it a barley wine or a classic strong ale? Certainly it's a toffee malty, dark fruited ruby ale that kicks. Personally I like richly fruit dark beer. It pours a polished chestnut body with fading lace. Taste is above medium sweet but it softens to a light bitter finish, like cake. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. The weekend crowd obviously didn't like it here so this 7.2abv is Â£3 a pint here. My gain. |
