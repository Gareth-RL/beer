| **Comments** | Bottle. It looks the part: rich and clear, chestnut body with good foam lace top. Aroma is bread malts not much hop in there just a hint of hedge more the twig than the fruit. But there is something about the style that doesn't play to dramatic scents. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Largely balanced but the bitter has more length. A good companion to a cheese Ploughman's, methinks. Less precisely matched to zucchini risotto, on this occasions. Medium to light bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish with the legendary twiggy note. I think we need to give traditional beer a break and rate the style. You won't get the fruit salad explosion of the new hoppy pales, and you won't get the dense taste mix of the pastry stouts, so when drinking bitter, try to appreciate English understatement. I am making that attempt. |
