| **Comments** | Poured cola brown with tan lace that gradually dissipated. Aroma is definitely coffee, some berry fruit and light spice. taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation, and a lingering spicy finish. A porter I would happily drink again. |
