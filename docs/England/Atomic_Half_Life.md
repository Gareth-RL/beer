| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours pale amber body with white lace top. Aroma has caramel malts and floral hops. Taste is medium sweet and bitter with a fruity back note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a growing bitter finish. Overall a nicely flavoured brew. |
