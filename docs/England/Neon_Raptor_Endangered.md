| **Comments** | Tap at the Neon Raptor Taproom Nottingham. Pours black with tan lacing. Aroma has vanilla from the barrel and some chocolate malt although the Bourbon is less pronounced than in other aged brews. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium to full bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall, pleasant but not as rich as some aged porters. |
