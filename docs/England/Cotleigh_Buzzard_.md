| **Comments** | Poured rich copper body with scummy lace top. Aroma has roasted malts and a hint of leather. Taste is medium sweet with light chocolate and berry notes. Decent bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Needs a real fireside chair to complete the English winter pub experience. |
