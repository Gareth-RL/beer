Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours amber gold with thin off white lace.
  Aroma has tropical fruit mango pineapple and the rest. Taste is more malted richly
  grained with sweet caramel giving way to tart fruit. Palate is medium bodied, smooth
  slick feel, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. As a first DIPA it
  bodes well. Don&#39;t wander too far away from this."'
