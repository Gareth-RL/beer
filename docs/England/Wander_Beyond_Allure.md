| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours amber gold with thin off white lace. Aroma has tropical fruit mango pineapple and the rest. Taste is more malted richly grained with sweet caramel giving way to tart fruit. Palate is medium bodied, smooth slick feel, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. As a first DIPA it bodes well. Don&#39;t wander too far away from this. |
