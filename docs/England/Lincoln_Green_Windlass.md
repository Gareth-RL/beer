| **Comments** | Draft at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours clear golden body with white lace. Aroma is citrus with a preponderance of lemon and grapefruit. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the grapefruit pith increasingly evident. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a definitely pithy bitter finish. Part of their Blackshale range that was more craft than cask orientated. Ideal for anyone who does not know how to peel a yellow grapefruit before eating. |
