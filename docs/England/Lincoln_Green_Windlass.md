Beer: Lincoln Green Windlass
BeerID: 970089
Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Draft at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours clear golden body with white
  lace. Aroma is citrus with a preponderance of lemon and grapefruit. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with the grapefruit pith increasingly evident. Palate is medium
  bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a definitely pithy bitter finish.
  Part of their Blackshale range that was more craft than cask orientated. Ideal for
  anyone who does not know how to peel a yellow grapefruit before eating.
