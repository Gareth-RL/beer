Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. You get what you asked for. Cherry is emphatically on the nose. Pours
  dark body with creamy lace top. Taste is medium to full sweetness due to cherry
  with a lactose tang. Palate is full to medium bodied, sticky rather than thick texture,
  but a creamy finish. I had a third and did not regret it was not a half. 24/02/24
  second sipping after 7 years. Still very cherry in an artificial way and I prefer
  the Raven
