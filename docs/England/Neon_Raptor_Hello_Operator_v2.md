Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Lets just ignore the Golden / Blonde
  typology. It pours purple with pink lacing. It smells of raspberry and peaches.
  It tastes light to medium sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation,
  and a dull finish more faded than lingering. So it&#39;s a fair attempt at a sour
  and a weird attempt at a Blonde."'
