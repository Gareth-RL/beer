Beer: Northern Monk / Bissell Brothers  Knucklepuck (Patrons Project 6.02)
BeerID: 547916
Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.
City: Leeds
Comments: Tap. Aroma has peach, mango and pineapples. Appearance is hazy light golden
  with white lace top. Taste is medium to strong sweet but with a growing bitter spine
  that ensures a sour finish with pleasant residual fruitiness. Palate is medium body,
  oily, sticky, .flat carbonation and long finish. The plaudits of Scots and Scandinavians
  go before me but I still liked it more than I expected. The pick of the session.
