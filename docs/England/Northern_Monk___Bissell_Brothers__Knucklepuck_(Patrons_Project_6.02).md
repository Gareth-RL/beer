| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has peach, mango and pineapples. Appearance is hazy light golden with white lace top. Taste is medium to strong sweet but with a growing bitter spine that ensures a sour finish with pleasant residual fruitiness. Palate is medium body, oily, sticky, .flat carbonation and long finish. The plaudits of Scots and Scandinavians go before me but I still liked it more than I expected. The pick of the session. |
