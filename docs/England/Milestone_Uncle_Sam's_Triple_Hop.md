| **Comments** | Cask. Strong orange and tangerine scent signals the hop preponderance. Pours orange golden with white lace top. Taste is predictably hop-driven with citrus and berry fruits softening the initial flavour but a bitter tang in the finish. Some resinous languor and medium carbonation but you may ask: Do you need Uncle Sam? |
