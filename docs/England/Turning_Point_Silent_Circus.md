Comments: On tap at the Canalhouse Nottingham. Pours cloudy amber with thin off-white
  lace top. The aroma is rich roasted malts with caramel notes and a definite boozy
  promise. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied , sticky
  feel, average to soft carbonation and a light sour to sweet languor. Overall a beer
  that made me want to drink Belgian beer more often.
