| **Comments** | Cask. Pours ruby with tan head. A full-throttled fruity aroma and the taste doesnâ€™t disappoint. Stewed plums, toasted malts maybe some mild almond pastry. Given the weighty ingredients, the body is medium to full with a relatively clean finish. Well rounded indeed and deserving its accolades. Seek it out. |
