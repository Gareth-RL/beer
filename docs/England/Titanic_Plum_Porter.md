Beer: Titanic Plum Porter
BeerID: 139663
Brewer: Titanic Brewery (UK)
City: Stoke-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Pours ruby with tan head. A full-throttled fruity aroma and the taste
  doesn’t disappoint. Stewed plums, toasted malts maybe some mild almond pastry. Given
  the weighty ingredients, the body is medium to full with a relatively clean finish.
  Well rounded indeed and deserving its accolades. Seek it out.
