Comments: '"Keg. Aroma is just as it should be roasted grain, bready with fruity background
  noise. Pours similarly correctly reddish with thin top. And I can taste what the
  brewer is aiming for: A balance of toasted malts and citrus hops. The only question
  mark is the ending. Smooth or soft? It kinda died on me. One of my highest scores.
