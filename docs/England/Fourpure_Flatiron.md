| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma is just as it should be roasted grain, bready with fruity background noise. Pours similarly correctly reddish with thin top. And I can taste what the brewer is aiming for: A balance of toasted malts and citrus hops. The only question mark is the ending. Smooth or soft? It kinda died on me. One of my highest scores. The craft revolution is confirmed  |
