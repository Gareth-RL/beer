| **Comments** | Cask. No aroma to speak of, but more basement than citrus. Pours pale gold with white lace top. Taste is hoppy with a mixture of soap and toffee - not a combination I had expected. Nevertheless it somehow works and the bitter residue makes you feel OK let’s have another, what’s the worst that can happen? &#40;some readers may know the answer to that&#033;&#41; |
