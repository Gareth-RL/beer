| **Comments** | Poured cloudy orange juice with white foam. Aroma citrus. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit throughout. If you missed your orange juice here you go. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good example of the style if heavy on the tangerine  |
