| **Comments** | Pours hazy golden with thin lace. Aroma has lemon and grapefruit and foretells a hoppy beer. Pale malts barely feature. Taste is medium to full drying bitter. A litmus test beer for how bitter and acerbic do you like your pale ale. Palate is light to medium bodied, drying, average carbonation and a bitter finish. A refresher for a summer beer garden rather than a session ale. But it is touted as a hoppy beer and it's that. Weller himself has more variety! |
