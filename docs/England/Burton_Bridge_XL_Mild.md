Beer: Burton Bridge XL Mild
BeerID: 9875
Brewer: Burton Bridge Brewery
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Aroma bready malts. Pours dark amber with tan lace top. Taste is medium
  sweet to start but a dry bitter grows in intensity to the finish. Light to medium
  body. Medium carbonation. A good session ale and better than the XL bitter. Offered
  at the Newshouse on the 2019 Mild Trail, and its traditional virtues match the pub.
