| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma bready malts. Pours dark amber with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to start but a dry bitter grows in intensity to the finish. Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. A good session ale and better than the XL bitter. Offered at the Newshouse on the 2019 Mild Trail, and its traditional virtues match the pub. |
