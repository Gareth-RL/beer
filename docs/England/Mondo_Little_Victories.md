| **Comments** | Aroma has a fairly conventional tropical fruit mix from the hops--grapefruit, pineapple and grassy notes. Poured clear golden body with thin white lace. The taste is medium sweet to sour bitter. To my mind the malts play a larger part in the bitter portion than in the first. Medium bodied, average to soft carbonation, some clamminess and a lingering rather than long finish with sour notes. Overall it delivers as a session IPA but that slightly sour finish might grate after a while. I'm not sure that this is a little victory I will cling to, but let's face it any victory is worth having these days. |
