Beer: Lazy Bay Chikara IPA
BeerID: 945839
Brewer: Lazy Bay Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Pours cloudy pale golden with white scummy top. Aroma has peach melon and
  apricot. Taste is light to medium sweet to slightly sour ( no real bitterness except
  as an aftertaste. Palate is medium bodied, soft carbonation, smooth texture but
  quite a short mineral chalky finish. Not sure what they were going for but having
  a stout with the same name threw me! Enjoying a quiet glass outside.
