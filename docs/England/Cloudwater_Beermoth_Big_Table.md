Comments: '"Tap at Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy amber brown with off white lace.
  Aroma is modestly fruity hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but it is not so
  much a transition as a  death. Palate is medium bodied, texture is oily, carbonation
  is average, finish is more murky than light. It&#39;s obvious to me that Saison
  is not my style but given the blandness of Little Table this is a step up."'
