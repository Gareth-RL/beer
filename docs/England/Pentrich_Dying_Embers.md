| **Comments** | Can from Adventure Beer. Pours chestnut body light tan foam lace top. Aroma of roasted malt a little light caramel. Medium sweet to bitter with more toffee malt along the way. Soft finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation for the can [I had to let the foam subside from the pour], and a soft lightly bitter finish. Certainly confirms that Dunkel is my lager of choice, and that Pentrich is generating new beers at a prodigious rate; I, for one, cannot keep pace, but it has become a local favourite for some of my drinking companions |
