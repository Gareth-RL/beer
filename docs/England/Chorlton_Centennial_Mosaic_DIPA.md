Beer: Chorlton Centennial Mosaic DIPA
BeerID: 574663
Brewer: Chorlton Brewing Company
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy orange golden with good white lace top.
  Aroma has a profusion of fruit pineapples grapefruit and papaya lying on a bed of
  straw. Taste is medium to full bitter by way of a sour intermission. Palate is medium
  to full with a grainy feel, average carbonation and a definite lasting bitter finish.
  It benefited from being preceded by sour ales to freshen my palate.
