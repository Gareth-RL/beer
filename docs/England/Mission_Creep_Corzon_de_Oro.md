Comments: Aroma has citrus hops and pale malt. . Slightly hazy golden pale body with
  thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet but increasingly bitter with a drying finish.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a dry finish. A very
  exotic name for a beer that reminded me of some bygone bitters.
