| **Comments** | Aroma has a resinous tannic fruit quality between plum and cherry wine. Pours cola dark and murky. Not much head apart from fleeting bubbles. Taste is medium to light body, slick feel, average carbonation and a palate caking fruit finish (but not in a good way). Overall not sure what to make of it other than avoid it. |
