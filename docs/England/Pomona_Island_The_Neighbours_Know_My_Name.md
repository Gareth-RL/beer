| **Comments** | Can. Poured black with tan cream lacing. Aroma is certainly chocolatey. Hints of dark fruits, nuts and liquorice. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. I have been sampling pastry stout of late so this did not strike me as particularly sweet within that range but I guess the hazelnut qualifies it as praline. Texture is medium to thick, creamy, soft carbonation and the 11% is disguised effectively & dangerously. I tossed back the 440ml with too little reflection. I think a brewer should use the word triple carefully so while this is chocolatey, there are others out there that are more so and in any case is triple 'qualifying' the chocolate or the praline or the stout; is it Anglicizing tripel? (You see, it is 11%). In any case it went down well and seemed to mark the purchase of a house during a pandemic with appropriate glee. |
