| **Comments** | Tap @ The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy orange with white lace halo top. Aroma is richly fruity raspberry and strawberry with lactic sour edge. Taste is medium sweet to light sour possibly not sour enough. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a lactose finish. A good beginning does not a story make. |
