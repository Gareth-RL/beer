Comments: '"Poured chestnut body thin lace top. Aroma of hedgerow hops. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with pleasant berry fruit notes. Light biscuit in the finish. Palate
  is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a medium bitter finish.
  Like so many bitters, it''s the epitome of moderation, and that makes it hard to
  rate exuberantly, but I tried!"'
