| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma licorice and coffee malts. Pours expresso black with white lacing. Taste is medium sweet with some bitterness in the finish. Very nice. 2021 Botte: a second sipping courtesy of a birthday gift box. The bitterness came through stronger this time but still a very nice porter, although the abv has drifted up to 6.1%  |
