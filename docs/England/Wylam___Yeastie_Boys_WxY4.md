| **Comments** | Aroma has the expected fruit combo but the vanilla was not forecast. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white lace. Taste is sweeter and fruitier but blends to a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation and a long fruit infused finish. The hops clearly win at this end of the keyboard. |
