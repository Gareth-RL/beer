Beer: Wylam / Yeastie Boys WxY4
BeerID: 727903
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Aroma has the expected fruit combo but the vanilla was not forecast. Pours
  cloudy yellow gold with white lace. Taste is sweeter and fruitier but blends to
  a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation and a long fruit infused
  finish. The hops clearly win at this end of the keyboard.
