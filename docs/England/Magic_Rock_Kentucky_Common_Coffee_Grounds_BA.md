Beer: Magic Rock Kentucky Common Coffee Grounds BA
BeerID: 515215
Brewer: Magic Rock Brewing (Odyssey Inns)
City: Huddersfield
Comments: Tap. Aroma has rich coffee within the Bourbon and the combination yields
  vanilla and caramel notes. Pours very dark black . Thin tan top. Taste is sweetened
  by the Bourbon and mellowed so that even with a soft carbonation this has a lasting
  feel on the palate. Shame that 2/3rds makes me feel like that is enough.
