| **Comments** | Tricky aroma the dark malt is obvious enough but the the fruit is hard to place plum cherry. I guess stoned fruit covers it. Given that it says Black Forest cherry seems the safer bet. Poured cola black thin top. Taste is not as sweet as you would expect. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. There are beers that grow on you and beers that fade. I can barely see it. |
