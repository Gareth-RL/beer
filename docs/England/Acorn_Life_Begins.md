| **Comments** | Light aroma of hops and malt. Pours dark amber heading towards chestnut body with lace top.. Taste is medium sweet with good fruit and growing bitter finish; quite a subtle transition. Palatte is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. But the best cask amber of JDW festival so far  |
