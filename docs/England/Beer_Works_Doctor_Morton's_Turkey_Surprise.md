| **Comments** | Cask at the Falcon. Pours golden with white top and clouded lacing. Aroma lemon and melon rind. Tastes predictably of dry and re-dried hops so sharp acidity to underscore the citrus notes. Some piny residue. I guess the surprise or the turkey was a pale ale for Christmas. It will become a Christmas. |
