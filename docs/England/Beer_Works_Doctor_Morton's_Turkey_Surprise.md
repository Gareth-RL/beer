Beer: '"Beer Works Doctor Morton''s Turkey Surprise"'
BeerID: 115586
Brewer: Abbeydale Brewery
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask at the Falcon. Pours golden with white top and clouded lacing. Aroma
  lemon and melon rind. Tastes predictably of dry and re-dried hops so sharp acidity
  to underscore the citrus notes. Some piny residue. I guess the surprise or the turkey
  was a pale ale for Christmas. It will become a Christmas.
