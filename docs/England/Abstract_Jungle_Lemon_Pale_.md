Comments: '"Tap @ Keans Head Nottingham. Pours golden amber with white lace top. Aroma
  is surprisingly more toffee malt than lemon hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with the butterscotch persistent. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average
  carbonation, and a soft bitter finish. Lord knows what it is."'
