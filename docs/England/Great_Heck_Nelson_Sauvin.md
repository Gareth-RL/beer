| **Comments** | Poured murky golden with white lace top. Aroma has stone fruits and grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Unremarkable but better than the murk implied. 25/02/20 second sipping. Less murky but much the same. |
