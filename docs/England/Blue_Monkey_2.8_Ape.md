| **Comments** | Poured golden body with thin and rapidly diminishing lace top. Aroma has citrus hop with light peach note and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, with a crisp bitter finish. An easy drinking session pale which has good flavour for the abv. |
