| **Comments** | Poured murky orange with off-white wash lace. Aroma of tangerine hops and pale malts. Medium sweet to piney bitter with plenty of citrus along the way. Light to medium bodied clammy texture and pithy finish and that mineral aftertaste that NEIPA have. But it's certainly Mandarina |
