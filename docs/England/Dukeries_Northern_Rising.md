Comments: '"Cask. Pours chestnut body white lace top. Aroma caramel, nuts, woody,
  it&#39;s a bitter. Taste is fruity medium sweet then twiggy bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied, average carbonation, slick feel, long, bitter finish. It&#39;s only the
  refreshing claim on the pump clip that I would quibble with. A mid session bitter."'
