Comments: 'Tap at the Head of Steam Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with white lace
  top. Aroma does indeed smell of vanilla custard so points for accuracy. Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation
  and a fruity finish but unsure it could be classed as rhubarb. A novelty. 28/06/23
  second sipping still vanilla and fruit of some description '
