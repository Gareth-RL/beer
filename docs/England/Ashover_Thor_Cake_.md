| **Comments** | How spicy do you like your brown ale? All the ingredients are present in the scent. Poured deep copper brown body with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but the spice is ever present. Palate is medium to light bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Spicing up a brown ale? Whatever next! |
