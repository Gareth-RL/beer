Comments: Poured dark brown amber with tan lace top. Aroma of brown bread and light
  berry hops. Taste is medium sweet initially with fruity and toffee notes. Sour finish.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a souring mash finish.
  Expected something else from an old ale more richness in the finish, perhaps.
