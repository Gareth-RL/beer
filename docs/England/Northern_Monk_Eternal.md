| **Comments** | Tap @ the Herbert Kilpin. Pours cloudy orange gold with off white lace. Aroma has the smack of tangerine with grapefruit and melon rind in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium, carbonation average, sticky texture, and the sour pith may outstay its welcome. Northern Monk need to contemplate beer beyond the eternal. Too many by the name. |
