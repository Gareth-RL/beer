| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with tan lace. Aroma has caramel malts and vanilla. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with toffee and vanilla the dominant flavours and a bit of dark chocolate at the back. Medium bodied, creamy textured, average to soft carbonation, and a light hop finish. It may be a gimmick and artificial but it goes down easily enough. |
