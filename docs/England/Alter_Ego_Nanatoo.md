Beer: Alter Ego Nanatoo
BeerID: 1071118
Brewer: Alter Ego Brewing Co.
City: Alfreton
Comments: Poured dark brown with tan lace. Aroma has caramel malts and vanilla. Medium
  sweet to lightly bitter with toffee and vanilla the dominant flavours and a bit
  of dark chocolate at the back. Medium bodied, creamy textured, average to soft carbonation,
  and a light hop finish. It may be a gimmick and artificial but it goes down easily
  enough.
