| **Comments** | Another member of the brewers Infinity range. Poured amber golden body with white lace top. Aroma has caramelized malts so toffee note. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little sharp hoppiness in the finish.. palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. So overall maltier than either Infinity or infinity+1.<br>Earlier Rating: 10/10/2019 Total Score: 3.5<br>Aroma of caramel malts and herbal hops. Pours hazy amber gold with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with toffee malt evident. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. A good addition to the Infinity range that shows it works in non-cask format.  |
