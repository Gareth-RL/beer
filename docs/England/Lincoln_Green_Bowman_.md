Comments: '"Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours pale amber more
  yellow than brown with white lace top. Aroma has some citrus hops. Taste however
  is ultimately more bitter than juicy. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not sure if it''s Americanized enough. 7/11/23
  tried first in 2018. Still a very ordinary pale"'
