Beer: Magic Rock / De Molen De Molé
BeerID: 594391
Brewer: Magic Rock Brewing (Odyssey Inns)
City: Huddersfield
Comments: Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan halo. Aroma has chocolate
  coffee, chili spice, and alcohol. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter amidst
  the swirls of chilies. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation
  and a finish that is chili dominated. I recognise that this was intended but I like
  my beer alongside a chili not infused quite this much.
