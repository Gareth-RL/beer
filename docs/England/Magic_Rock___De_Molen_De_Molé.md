| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours black with tan halo. Aroma has chocolate coffee, chili spice, and alcohol. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter amidst the swirls of chilies. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation and a finish that is chili dominated. I recognise that this was intended but I like my beer alongside a chili not infused quite this much. |
