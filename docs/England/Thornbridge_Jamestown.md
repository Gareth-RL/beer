BeerID: 770333
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Poured a murky cloudy straw pale with foamy white lace top. Heady aroma
  of papaya and pineapple with peachy back notes. Taste is medium juicy sweetness
  with grapefruit pith and pineapple dominating the transition to a full bitterness.
  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth textured, average to soft carbonation and a lasting
  bitter finish. It also lacks the chalky finish that mars so many NEIPAs for me.
  So well done the Bakewell crew!
