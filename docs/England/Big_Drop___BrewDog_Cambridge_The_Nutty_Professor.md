Beer: Big Drop / BrewDog Cambridge The Nutty Professor
BeerID: 777922
Brewer: Big Drop Brewing Co.
City: Ipswich
Comments: A mixed bag. A rich chocolate hazelnut scent - pass the Nutella. A decent
  dark body with halo. But taste and texture let it down. Taste is medium sweet to
  bitter but the sweet but is artificial and the bitterness is ashtray. Palate is
  also well below stout proportions. Thin, clammy at best, average carbonation and
  a finish that reverberates artifice. Still admirable to get so much out of 0.5 abv.
