Comments: Given the weather, this porter's suggestion that I gaze into a winter fire makes sense this June. Poured black body tan cream lace.  Chocolate coffee malts noted in the scent as the cmkeg chill diminished.  Briefly sweet but abidingly bitter thanks to the hop malt mix. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish with a little ashen note. I expect a pint on cask would taste even better. As it is,  I preferred the Suen Recurring Dreams I had immediately before it. A high bar.
