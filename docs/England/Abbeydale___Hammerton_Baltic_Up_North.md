Comments: '"Roasted malts and grainy notes. Poured dark chestnut with thin lace top.
  Taste is medium sweet but with enough licorice and coffee to bring the bitterness
  to a closing finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. I''m hardly a connoisseur of Baltic porters but this was easy
  drinking: dangerously so, given the abv."'
