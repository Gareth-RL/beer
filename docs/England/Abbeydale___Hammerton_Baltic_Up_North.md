| **Comments** | Roasted malts and grainy notes. Poured dark chestnut with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet but with enough licorice and coffee to bring the bitterness to a closing finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. I'm hardly a connoisseur of Baltic porters but this was easy drinking: dangerously so, given the abv. |
