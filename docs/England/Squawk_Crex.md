Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden body with white lace
  top. Aroma has the usual array of fruity hops lime pineapple and pink grapefruit
  pith. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average
  carbonation and a chalky finish. Good enough but it could lose its charm.
