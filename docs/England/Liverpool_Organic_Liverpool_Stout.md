Beer: Liverpool Organic Liverpool Stout
BeerID: 199523
Brewer: Liverpool Organic Brewery
City: Liverpool
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with ruby tints in the light. Aroma is caramel and cough
  drops. Tastes more s yr ongly if smoked roasted malts and yes a hint of pepper at
  the end. Given the weight on the palate if someone had called it porter rather than
  stout I wouldn’t have noticed.
