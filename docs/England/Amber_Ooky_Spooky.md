| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of pale malts and floral grassy hops. Pours golden with white lacing. Taste has medium sweetness and light bitterness with a ginger beer finish. Palate light to medium bodied, soft to average carbonation, spicy finish. Overall more summery than spectral. The ginger may make it ooky to some |
