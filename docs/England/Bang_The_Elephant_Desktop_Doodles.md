| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma of roasted malts with stone fruits and licorice evident. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruit evident and a licorice tang finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Lovely stuff. The elephant scores again  |
