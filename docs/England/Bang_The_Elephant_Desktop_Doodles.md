Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma of roasted malts with stone
  fruits and licorice evident. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruit evident and
  a licorice tang finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Lovely stuff. The elephant scores again '
