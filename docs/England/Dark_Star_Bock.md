BeerID: 562654
Brewer: Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi)
City: Horsham
Comments: Cask at the Sir John. Pours dark mahogany with ruby lights and thin tan
  top. Aroma dark malts with bread, dark fruit and soya. Taste is medium sweet to
  bitter with a licorice twist to finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  to soft carbonation, and languid finish. Overall it was better than I had hoped
  and headed into Porter territory.
