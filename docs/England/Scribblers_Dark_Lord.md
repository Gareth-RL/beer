| **Comments** | Aroma of dark malt coffee and chocolate noted. Pours ruby chestnut with scummy lace top. Taste is caramel malts with fruit notes so medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is thin to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Tastes like a porter but feels like a Mild 29/01/20 second sipping my kind of thing. |
