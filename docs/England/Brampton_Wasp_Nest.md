| **Comments** | Bottle from Adventure Beer Company. Aroma is caramel malt with a hint of berry hops. Poured clear amber body with thin lacing fading to halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with toffee malt dominant initially and hop biscuit overtaking that in the finish. This is what bitter does, it balances. Palate is medium bodied, grainy in texture, average to more carbonation, and a lightly spiced bitter finish. I wanted to like this more than I do which is how I feel about a lot of Brampton's beers. They are decent enough but only occasionally memorable. |
