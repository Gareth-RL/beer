Brewer: Wander Beyond Brewing
City: Manchester
Comments: A lactose nose like the lid off a yoghurt pot. Pours the deepest purple
  with pink foam. Murky. Taste is a sweet to sour combo that to me always drifts from
  bubble gum to frozen yoghurt. But the blueberries are definitely there. Palate is
  medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a sour cheese finish. One of an increasing
  number of beers that I can confidently say would have baffled my ancestors and many
  contemporaries. This is beer. I can hear the chorus.
