| **Comments**  | Poured rich chestnut body and tan foam lace top. Aroma genuflects to the coffee rather than the rye. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a fairly standard Mild palate but with a coffee twist. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It's not easy to impress with a Mild, but I would have it again                                                                                       |
