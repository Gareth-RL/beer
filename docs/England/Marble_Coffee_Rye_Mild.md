Comments: '"Poured rich chestnut body and tan foam lace top. Aroma genuflects to the
  coffee rather than the rye. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a fairly standard
  Mild palate but with a coffee twist. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. It''s not easy to impress with a Mild, but I would have it
  again "'
