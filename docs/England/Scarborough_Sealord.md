Comments: '"Cask. Aroma is pretty light but maybe faint lemon zest. Pours golden with
  a white top &#40;so the type fits&#41;. It has an odd watery taste but as it’s the
  second odd one this evening I may be off the mark tonight. I note reviews in 2014
  were kinder so fear this may be old stuff&#033; It tastes like it."'
