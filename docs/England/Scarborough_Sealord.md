| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is pretty light but maybe faint lemon zest. Pours golden with a white top &#40;so the type fits&#41;. It has an odd watery taste but as itâ€™s the second odd one this evening I may be off the mark tonight. I note reviews in 2014 were kinder so fear this may be old stuff&#033; It tastes like it. |
