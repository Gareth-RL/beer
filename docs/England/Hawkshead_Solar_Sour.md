| **Comments** | Lactic to the point of cheese in the scent. Pours hazy pale golden body with thin lace. Taste is sour yoghurt with sour cream so this is a sour for the truly sour. Palate is thin to medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a big sour taste that stays a while. Not my thing. |
