BeerID: 329741
Brewer: Hawkshead Brewery (Halewood International)
City: Staveley
Comments: Lactic to the point of cheese in the scent. Pours hazy pale golden body
  with thin lace. Taste is sour yoghurt with sour cream so this is a sour for the
  truly sour. Palate is thin to medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation
  and a big sour taste that stays a while. Not my thing.
