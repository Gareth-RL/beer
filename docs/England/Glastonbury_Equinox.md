Comments: Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of roasted malts and pine and grapefruit hops. Medium sweet to bitter with more malt playing with increasing grapefruit flavour. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly an interesting ale with porter elements
