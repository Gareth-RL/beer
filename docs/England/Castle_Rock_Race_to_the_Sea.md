Beer: Castle Rock Race to the Sea
BeerID: 552936
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma has nuts, hay, on the malt front and grass, herbs, on the hop,
  edging towards lemongrass. Pours cloudy orange gold with a dissipating thin white
  top. Taste is medium to light sour and bitter with any sweetness as a light background
  note. Palate is light to medium bodied, slick feel, flat carbonation, and a soft
  sour finish. I will not race back.
