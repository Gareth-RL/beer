| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has nuts, hay, on the malt front and grass, herbs, on the hop, edging towards lemongrass. Pours cloudy orange gold with a dissipating thin white top. Taste is medium to light sour and bitter with any sweetness as a light background note. Palate is light to medium bodied, slick feel, flat carbonation, and a soft sour finish. I will not race back. |
