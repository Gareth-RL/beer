Beer: Lymestone Lymestone Cowboy
BeerID: 129777
Brewer: Lymestone Brewery
City: Stone
Comments: Cask. Aroma yeasty malts with a little berry fruit in the background. Pours
  amber honey with a white lace top. A soft mouthful with a bitter finish. Not a lot
  going on but then again not a lot going wrong, which in today’s world is close to
  a commendation. So to be clear - average.
