| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma yeasty malts with a little berry fruit in the background. Pours amber honey with a white lace top. A soft mouthful with a bitter finish. Not a lot going on but then again not a lot going wrong, which in todayâ€™s world is close to a commendation. So to be clear - average. |
