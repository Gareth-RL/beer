| **Comments** | Cask. Rich malty scent. Pours chestnut brown with thick white top. Full lace wash. Taste is pleasantly malted with medium sweetness and an undertow of hop bitterness. Carbonation is flat to light. Finish is soft and palate is creamy in the finish. I respect the flavorful character achieved with a low abv. Imperial stout has an intrinsic advantage. |
