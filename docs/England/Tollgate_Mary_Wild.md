BeerID: 511030
Brewer: Tollgate Brewery
City: Ashby-de-la-Zouch
Comments: Cask. Rich malty scent. Pours chestnut brown with thick white top. Full
  lace wash. Taste is pleasantly malted with medium sweetness and an undertow of hop
  bitterness. Carbonation is flat to light. Finish is soft and palate is creamy in
  the finish. I respect the flavorful character achieved with a low abv. Imperial
  stout has an intrinsic advantage.
