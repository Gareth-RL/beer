| **Comments** | Pours black body with tan lace top. Aroma of dark malts coffee chocolate dates. Hints of woodsmoke Taste is medium sweet with a smooth transition to a light bitterness. Palate is medium to full body smooth texture soft carbonation and a light bitterness. It meets the challenge of dampening the alcohol without hyping the sweetness. Good stuff. |
