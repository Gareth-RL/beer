Comments: Pours black body with tan lace top. Aroma of dark malts coffee chocolate
  dates. Hints of woodsmoke Taste is medium sweet with a smooth transition to a light
  bitterness. Palate is medium to full body smooth texture soft carbonation and a
  light bitterness. It meets the challenge of dampening the alcohol without hyping
  the sweetness. Good stuff.
