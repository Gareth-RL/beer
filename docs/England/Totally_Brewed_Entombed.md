Comments: '"Pours cloudy golden body with thin halo. Aroma is a murkiness of herbal
  and citrus hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter:  somehow the fruit doesn''t know
  how to behave. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation
  with a toothpaste finish. What is the point?"'
