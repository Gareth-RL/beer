| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours amber gold with white lace top. Aroma is citrus hops and caramel malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter wrapped in creaminess. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a languid finish. I had planned a more circumspect finish to an early evening session but this spoke to me. More power to it. |
