| **Comments**  | Poured clear golden thin lace top. Aroma of honey and floral hops. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more honey and floral hops in the taste. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I guess it does what it says on the tin. But hardly exciting for my 100th beer from S. Yorkshire.                                                                                      |
