| **Comments** | Aroma of mango pineapple tangerine and grapefruit from all those hops. Pours murky brown gold with off white lacing. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finishing note. Certainly a beer that pleases, despite the cryptic name. I might add the clich√© that it's dangerously drinkable but really I should leave that to you. |
