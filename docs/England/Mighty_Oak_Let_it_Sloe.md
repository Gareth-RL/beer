Brewer: Mighty Oak Brewing Co.

Comments: Poured clear chestnut body with thin lace top.. aroma has blackcurrant and
  berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter fruity.so maybe the sloes smooth and
  lengthen the transition.. medium to light bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish.. the bottle art is more exciting than the beer itself.
