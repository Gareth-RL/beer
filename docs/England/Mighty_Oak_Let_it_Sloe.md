| **Comments** | Poured clear chestnut body with thin lace top.. aroma has blackcurrant and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter fruity.so maybe the sloes smooth and lengthen the transition.. medium to light bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.. the bottle art is more exciting than the beer itself. |
