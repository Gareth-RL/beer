Brewer: Big Hug Brewing
City: North Kensington
Comments: Tap. Pours cloudy golden with white lace top. Aroma is intriguing. There’s
  a tropical element probably passionfruit but also muted pineapple and citrus and
  bread, and cheeses. It’s these that add complexity to a taste that is simpler -
  light sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour, umami, in short confusing but
  in a calm way. Both start and finish is light body, average carbonation, and oblique.
  Like a smile from a barmaid.
