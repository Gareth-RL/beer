| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of lightly toasted caramelized malt. Nice copper body and thin cream top. Pleasantly full taste with the malty sweetness blending well with the Brewers Fold hops. Quite light and loose in the finish with a refreshing aeration. It could be a good session bitter and shows why JW Lees are still there&#045;&#045;13 years to the bicentenary. |
