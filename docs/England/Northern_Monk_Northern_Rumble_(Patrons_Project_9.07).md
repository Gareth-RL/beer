| **Comments** | Aroma has pineapples and sweetened lemons.  Pours hazy pale golden body with white lace. Taste is medium sweet with a coating that could pass for sugar. Light sour finish. Palate is medium bodied mouth covering feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish. You don't notice the abv. |
