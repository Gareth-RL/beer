| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours amber body thin white lace top. Aroma of plums on the turn, herbs, earthy, roasted malts. Taste is medium medium sweetness, medium bitterness, slightly salty, and very obviously alcoholic &#40;it didn&#39;t need a boost from 8.4% really&#41;. Palate suffers: Still medium bodied, but the texture is sticky, and the carbonation is edging up beyond average, finish is more burn than bitter. Get your act together Buxton or go back to the ranch. |
