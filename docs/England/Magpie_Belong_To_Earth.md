| **Comments** | The sherbet effect is in both aroma and taste, enhancing the fruity sweetness or aggravating it depending on your point of view. Aroma has mango and pineapple. Pours a hazy golden with white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel, average carbonation and a light sour finish. Decent.  |
