BeerID: 668853
Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: Tap at the Canalhouse Nottingham. Chosen as this is one of a small number
  of styles yet untried. However it is a lager so not high on my list. Pours honey
  gold with thin lace halo. Aroma has pale malt and grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet
  to crisply bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and
  a crisp finish. Overall unremarkable but maybe the Germans do it better.
