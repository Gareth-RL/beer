Beer: Navigation Oast House
BeerID: 287485
Brewer: Navigation Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Golden with bubbly white top. Aroma apple and grapefruit. Considering
  the colour and scent this is less hoppy than one might expect. There’s a bitterness
  for sure with some countervailing sweetness but neither the balance nor the body
  impresses. A bit bland.
