Comments: This one splits the judges.  Pours dark brown body tan lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts coffee nut and chocolate.  Medium sweet and definitely bitter as the coffee notes sharpens at the finish.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  A decent stout IMO .whistle &flute Nottingham
