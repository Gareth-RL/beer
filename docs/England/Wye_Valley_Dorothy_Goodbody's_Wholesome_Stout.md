Comments: 'This one splits the judges.  Pours dark brown body tan lace top.  Aroma
  of roasted malts coffee nut and chocolate.  Medium sweet and definitely bitter as
  the coffee notes sharpens at the finish.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish.  A decent stout IMO .whistle &flute Nottingham '
