| **Comments** | Cert ainly running the hop mix on the current pale range: Centennial, Ekuanot, Mosaic and Vic Secret. Dank tropical aroma. Cloudy orange juice with thin lace. Taste is non-sequential and thus complex to the likes of me. Initially sweet and bitter it's then more bitter than sweet although the two intertwined throughout. (Parental advisory). Palate is the familiar medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and long finish of the NEIPA family. Let no one ponder the name of the beer, that way madness lies, but if you experience a lightness of being after the second sipping, all will be both clear and unclear. (I'll get my coat).  |
