| **Comments** | @Nottingham beer festival. Pours dark cream top. Wondrously chocolate mint aroma. Taste smooth medium to strong sweetness with light bitter notes. Palate no more than medium bodied soft carbonation smooth feel. A lingering finish but wish it were longer. The find of the festival. |
