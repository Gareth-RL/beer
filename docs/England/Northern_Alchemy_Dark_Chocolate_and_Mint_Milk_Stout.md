Comments: '"@Nottingham beer festival. Pours dark cream top. Wondrously chocolate
  mint aroma. Taste smooth medium to strong sweetness with light bitter notes. Palate
  no more than medium bodied soft carbonation smooth feel. A lingering finish but
  wish it were longer. The find of the festival."'
