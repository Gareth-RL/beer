| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of dark malts lactose and vanilla.  Medium to full sweet with vanilla ice cream flavour as promised.  Not getting the cookie dough so much (that's fine by me). Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Enough pastry for one beer.                                                                                      |
