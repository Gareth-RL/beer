Comments: Good to know the cognoscenti drank this 10 years or more ago. Aroma has
  citrus hops (imagine the novelty back then). Pours clear golden pale with white
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to crisp bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture
  average carbonation and a crisp bitter finish. Once good and now average. But there
  are worse.
