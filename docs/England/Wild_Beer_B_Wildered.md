Beer: Wild Beer B*Wildered
BeerID: 713932
Brewer: '"Wild Beer (Curious Brewing - St. Peter&#39;s)"'
City: Shepton Mallet
Comments: Sour cherry nose. Dark malt below. Pours dark brown with thin lace top.
  Taste is full sweet with rich fruity flavour and slow building bitter finish although
  the sweetness never really goes away. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel with chocolate
  coating, average to soft carbonation. Once the creamy sweetness dies back the bitter
  finish is abrupt. A cliff hanger 4.0? But I wanted more dark chocolate.
