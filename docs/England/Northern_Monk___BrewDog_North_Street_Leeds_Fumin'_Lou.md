| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours murky brown with halo of soiled lace. Aroma has all that one can expect vanilla, gingerbread, toffee and spice. Taste is is medium sweet to bitter although the overarching spiciness complicates that journey considerably. Palate has no more than medium body if that. Carbonation is average to soft, given the ginger kick. Feel is thin with a little cling in the finish which is astringent. An experiment that teaches rather than succeeds. We need those occasionally. |
