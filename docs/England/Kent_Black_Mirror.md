| **Comments**  | Poured dark reddish brown body tan cream top. Aroma has roasted malts and dry hops with the light chocolate of the first blending with the pine of the second to supply a hint of licorice. Taste is lightly sweet to intensifyingly bitter. The malt fades as the hops take charge. A dry stout indeed. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a long bitter finish                                                                                       |
