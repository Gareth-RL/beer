| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours black body coffee tan top. Aroma has roasted dark malts chocolate cake. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite liquorice tang. Palate is medium to full, creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, languorous finish. Very solid but Thornbridge can do better. Rail Ale 2018 The pour is very similar but the aroma is less. By the same token, the taste is similar but the palate is marked by livelier carbonation - the perils of beer portage. An extravagance for me in the plethora of other options. |
