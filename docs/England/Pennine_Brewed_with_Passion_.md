Brewer: Pennine Brewing Co.

Comments: Cask. Pours yellow gold with white top. Aroma modestly fruity. Taste is
  medium sweetness, lightly bitter, and the passionfruit and orange are scarcely perceptible.
  There are hops that produce more. But it is a perfectly presentable session ale
  - ideally for another summer.
