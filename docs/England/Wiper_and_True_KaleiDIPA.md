| **Comments** | Tap at the Lincolnshire Poacher  &#40;to my surprise.&#41;. Pours cloudy golden scummy top. Aroma has mango and peach, even a hint of papaya and guava for those who care. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky, full feel, average carbonation, and a.long finish. Clearly it can induce euphoria in Somerset, but at the prices charged for a third in Nottingham, even an elixir needs to be special. |
