| **Comments** | I like Nutbrook so Iâ€™m rating this again. Aroma is still light lemon and grassy. Yellow gold colour with thin top. Taste crisper and fuller bodied. But still lacking the distinctive quality of Nutbrook 5th among others. Still there is a refreshing tang on the palate. So a better barrel. |
