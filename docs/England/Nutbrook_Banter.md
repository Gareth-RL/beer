Beer: Nutbrook Banter
BeerID: 106567
Brewer: Nutbrook Brewery
City: West Hallam
Comments: I like Nutbrook so I’m rating this again. Aroma is still light lemon and
  grassy. Yellow gold colour with thin top. Taste crisper and fuller bodied. But still
  lacking the distinctive quality of Nutbrook 5th among others. Still there is a refreshing
  tang on the palate. So a better barrel.
