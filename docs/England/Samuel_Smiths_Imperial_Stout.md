Comments: '"Poured cola black body with no lacing of any description which was not
  so much a surprise as a disappointment--this is a stout! Aroma has roasted malts
  with some dark fruit, some molasses and hints of aniseed. Taste is medium sweet
  with more of the same with some coffee mixed in for good measure. Texture is thin
  to medium bodied, smooth feel, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter licorice
  finish. Reading top raters reviews, I am struck by how the Scandinavians were into
  this remarkably early (2000s) whereas the Brits are a decade later. Both seem extravagant,
  but hey I''m recovering from COVID"'
