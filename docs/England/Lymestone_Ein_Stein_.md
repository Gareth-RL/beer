| **Comments**  | Poured clear golden body thin lace top. Aroma floral hop pale malts. Medium sweet to bitter the fruit passes quickly and the finish is lightly bitter. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. At 5.0%, It's 0.5% higher than the Welbeck Abbey Rapunzel but the difference is more apparent in texture than flavour. It's less watery and the hop flavours linger more. They are also softer and that might make it a more enticing session ale.                                                                                      |
