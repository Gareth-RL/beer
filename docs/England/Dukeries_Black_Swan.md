| **Comments** | Listed as a dark mild. On draught at the Roebuck &#40;JDW&#41;. Pours black cream head. Caramel malt notes in the aroma. A smooth balanced ale with biscuit malt and hoppy bitterness paralleled to the point of cancellation.Modest pleasant carbonation but no great languor on the palate. In short, it glides down like a swan and if itâ€™s night, you may nit even notice its passing. 28/07/17 Cask. Aroma has cereal, resin, leather, woody, raisin, there’s plenty there. A dark ruby body with a tan foam top. Taste is medium bitter with caramel sweetness softening throughout. Palate is  creamy. Not a  great mild but not a bad beer. |
