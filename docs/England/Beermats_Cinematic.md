Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company
City: Winkburn
Comments: Poured clear pale yellow white lace top. Aroma fruity and quite tropical
  for an English pale. Medium sweet to bitter with long fruity languor. Medium bodied
  smooth texture average carbonation and a sharp finish. Odd. But good. 23/03/2024
  now part of the JDW festival. Still Juicy for an English pale.
