| **Comments** | Cask. Pours mahogany with a red cast. Tan cream head yielding good lacing. Aroma caramel, toast, herbs, dough, earthy, raisin, even hints of smoke and vanilla. Taste has malts to the fore with caramel notes and a medium to strong sweetness but this matures to a smooth bitter finish. Carbonation light to soft and overall a fine ale if hardly a stout. |
