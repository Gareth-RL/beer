Beer: Grainstore Rutland Beast
BeerID: 19684
Brewer: Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.)
City: Oakham
Comments: Cask. Pours mahogany with a red cast. Tan cream head yielding good lacing.
  Aroma caramel, toast, herbs, dough, earthy, raisin, even hints of smoke and vanilla.
  Taste has malts to the fore with caramel notes and a medium to strong sweetness
  but this matures to a smooth bitter finish. Carbonation light to soft and overall
  a fine ale if hardly a stout.
