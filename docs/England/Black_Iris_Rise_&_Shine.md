| **Comments** | Cask. Pleasant coffee and caramel malt aromas Pours dark with thin broken tan lacing. The pleasure lies (as it should) in the tasting where sweetness melds into a rich intensity that marries smooth texture to bubbly sweetness. Given that Black Iris has excelled with pales recently, this is a surprise. Bravo! |
