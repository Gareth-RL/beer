Beer: Black Iris Rise & Shine
BeerID: 344319
Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pleasant coffee and caramel malt aromas Pours dark with thin broken
  tan lacing. The pleasure lies (as it should) in the tasting where sweetness melds
  into a rich intensity that marries smooth texture to bubbly sweetness. Given that
  Black Iris has excelled with pales recently, this is a surprise. Bravo!
