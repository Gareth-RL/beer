| **Comments** | Pours golden body with white foam top. Aroma of gentle satsuma zest. Taste is medium sweet to bitter, tangy finish. Palate is medium bodied average carbonation smooth texture and marmalade pithy finish. Better than most. Second sipping. Same location  18/01/22. Same outcome as I remain a generous soul. |
