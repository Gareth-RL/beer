| **Comments** | Keg or cask at The Keans Head Nottingham. Pours dark cola brown. No head to speak of in the keg version at least. The aroma has most of my malt favourites: coffee, chocolate, caramel with a little licorice in the finish. Taste is medium to full sweet with light bitter notes. Rich. Palate is medium + in terms of body, sticky texture, soft carbonation and a long languorous finish. I can&#39;t imagine drinking more of this than a third at a time but if it added to the look and the feel, it would be a first rate Imperial. |
