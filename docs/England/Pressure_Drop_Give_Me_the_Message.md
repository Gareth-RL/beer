| **Comments** | Can from the Overdraught in these perilous times. Poured very dark body with rich brown tan cream top. Aroma is roasted coffee chocolate malts with herbal hop which edges towards the brassica scent, which is rarely a strength in a beer. So admire the look before you smell it. The taste has some hop fruit and not the dry malty flavour that a standard stout might deliver, but pleasant enough in its way. Certainly the texture is stout like with medium to full body, smooth creamy feel, soft to average carbonation and a long finish. It's unlikely to become a classic but it certainly fits the strong stout category with something different from the sweeter malt versions. I am trying to be generous at a time when much of what I read about life globally and locally is enough to drive a man to drink and without dwelling on the thought that I don't want this to be the last beer I taste.  Visiting supermarkets stripped of countless items by my frantic fellow countrymen and pondering what the weeks ahead hold, I repeat to myself that beer does more than Milton can to justify God's way to Man. But it may not be this beer...  |
