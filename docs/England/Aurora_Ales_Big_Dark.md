Comments: At the Rail Ale festival 2018. Pours dark body with tan cream top and it
  was foamy. Aroma has fruity hops amidst the roasted malts and that is a winning
  combination for me. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter although the latter
  grows in the finish. Palate is medium bodied but sticky verging on creamy texture,
  carbonation average to lively finish is long and lazy. Even with a pepperoni pizza
  for competition it kept my attention.
