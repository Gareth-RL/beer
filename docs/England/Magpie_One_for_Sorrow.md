| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Pours dark brown with tan head. The taste has more caramelized malts and bitter chocolate but with dark fruit notes. Overall the best Magpie beer that Iâ€™ve had in a while. 02/13/24 Seven years later the aroma is sweeter and more milky. Looks the same. Now more milk chocolate than bitter dark but the caramel is still there. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good stuff  |
