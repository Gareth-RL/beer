Comments: 'Cask. Aroma of coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Pours dark brown with
  tan head. The taste has more caramelized malts and bitter chocolate but with dark
  fruit notes. Overall the best Magpie beer that I’ve had in a while. 02/13/24 Seven
  years later the aroma is sweeter and more milky. Looks the same. Now more milk chocolate
  than bitter dark but the caramel is still there. Medium bodied grainy texture average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Good stuff '
