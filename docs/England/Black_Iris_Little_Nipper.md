Comments: '"Can. Probably my lowest rating for a BI beer but then again it was three
  fifths foam . Some beers don''t can well. Tropical scent. Murky body and abundant
  foam.  Typical NEIPA taste of grapefruit papaya et alia. Medium bodied chalky texture
  above average carbonation and a sour finish. Try it on draft."'
