Brewer: Turning Point Brew Co.
City: Knaresborough
Comments: Cask at the Canal House. Pours dark body and creamy tan top. Aroma is dark
  malts with coffee and milk chocolate. Taste is medium sweet and only lightly bitter
  as the lactose sustained the sweetness. Palate is medium more than full with a slightly
  watery element in the texture, soft carbonation and a creamy finish. The milk element
  had undue influence here. 26/01/22 second sipping creamy coffee more evident.
