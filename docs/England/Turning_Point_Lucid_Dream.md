| **Comments** | Cask at the Canal House. Pours dark body and creamy tan top. Aroma is dark malts with coffee and milk chocolate. Taste is medium sweet and only lightly bitter as the lactose sustained the sweetness. Palate is medium more than full with a slightly watery element in the texture, soft carbonation and a creamy finish. The milk element had undue influence here. 26/01/22 second sipping creamy coffee more evident. |
