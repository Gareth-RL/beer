Comments: Poured cola brown body thin tan lace. Aroma of dark coffee malt and grapefruit hops. Medium sweet to bitter with the coffee and grapefruit pushing the dry finish . Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Normally I look for the malt in a stout but this is certainly hop forward.
