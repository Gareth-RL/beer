| **Comments** | Cask. A caramelized malt aroma with dark fruit tones. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights. A tan cream top. Some berry fruits in the taste alongside more malt and liquorice in the finish. Some viscous qualities on the palate but reasonably soft carbonation. I liked it more than I expected. 09/05/18 And better the second time around in terms of palate. |
