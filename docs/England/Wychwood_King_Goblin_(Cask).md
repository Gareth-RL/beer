| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark brown copper lights with creamy head.Tastes like feuitcake with a licorice tang. The second swallow morphs towards the cough medicine end so there’s a slightly acidic undertow that is carried in the carbonation. This may reflect its bottled origin and one can imagine a pleasant pour of winter ale on a wet night. But in the pub it’s a beer that works solo. Not sure what could follow and certain that a second wouldn’t improve the evening. And so it goes. |
