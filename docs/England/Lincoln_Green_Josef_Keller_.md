| **Comments** | Cask. A seasonal stout. Smells more cherry than chocolate. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights. Tan top. Lace wash. Richly fruit flavoured with chocolate notes. A festive beer but probably not one for a long session  5/11/18 given that I like stout and Lincoln Green I decided to revisit this low score. And second time around the chocolate was in the scent but not enough to raise the score above 7. Looks the same. Taste was also more chocolate this November so the move towards dipped cherries was approved. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture average carbonation and a bitter but fruity finish. Overall I am a better man and this is a better stout  |
