| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee with thin tan lace. Aroma has the smoky peaty notes, but also coffee grounds amid the roasted malts. A great Imperial Porter in terms of scent, But you don&#39;t buy beer just to smell it. Taste is medium bitter lightly sweet and medium sour and certainly the endnote is more ashy bitter and sour. It&#39;s not a taste you want to linger as long as it does. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and that growing bitter finish. This is a fine beer but I am glad I am tasting it rather than drinking it all night. |
