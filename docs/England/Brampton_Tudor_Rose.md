| **Comments** | Some citrus hope and honeyed malt: balanced. Clear golden body and white lace top. Medium sweet with grapefruit notes smooth transition and a bitter crisp finish. Medium bodied, creamy feel, average carbonation, and a lingering finish. The profile does not give a pleasant finish. To quote my son it is a digestive biscuit or a vanilla ice cream in the sense of average and unremarkable, It will do no harm. |
