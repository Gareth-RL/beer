| **Comments** | Cask at Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours murky orange brown with little head so I swopped it! Barrel end. But what I hd was lightly citrus hops on the nose and medium sweet to bitter on the tongue. Palate was also medium oily feel average carbonation and bitter finish. So if the dregs see this good, the rest should be superior. Second sipping 22/01/24 Five years later. And a better specimen  Clear golden body thin lace top.  Citrus fruit aroma. Medium sweet to bitter. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. @Sir John borlase Warren  |
