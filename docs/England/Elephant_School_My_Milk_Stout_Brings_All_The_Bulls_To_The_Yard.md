Overall: 13.0
MyScore: 3.5
Comments: Poured mahogany brown body tan cream top. Aroma of milk chocolate malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more chocolate evident. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. So, Brentwood has a captive microbrewery labelled Elephant School. Just to add to the toil of adding beer to the site.
