Comments: '"Can from Lidl. Poured pale yellow body with white foam top. Aroma of  lemon
  grass and pine as befits the Simcoe hops; I can''t say the passionfruit came through.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with rapid transition; the hop acidity was dominant.
  Palate was light to medium bodied, grainy texture, average carbonation, and a crisp
  bitter finish. An easy drinking pale."'
