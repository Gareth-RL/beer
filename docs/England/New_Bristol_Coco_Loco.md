| **Comments** | Pours cloudy orange golden with white lace foam. Aroma has plenty of citrus grapefruit lemon zest. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter quite drying. Coconut was promised but it eluded me. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. |
