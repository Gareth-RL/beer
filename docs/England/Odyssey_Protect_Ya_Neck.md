| **Comments** | Aroma of pale malt and muted pineapple hops. Pours hazy golden body with white lace.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it belongs in the large category of pales that have displaced bitter and whose name you don't recall. |
