Comments: 'Aroma of papaya passionfruit and pineapples and other fruit not beginning
  with p. Pours cloudy dank orange with bubbly lace halo. Taste is a real juice fest
  so sweet to the fore with light lactic souring to finish. Palate is medium bodied
  clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall Ideal for a sunny
  day  '
