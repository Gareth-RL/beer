| **Comments** | Aroma of papaya passionfruit and pineapples and other fruit not beginning with p. Pours cloudy dank orange with bubbly lace halo. Taste is a real juice fest so sweet to the fore with light lactic souring to finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall Ideal for a sunny day   |
