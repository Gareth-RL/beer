Beer: Beermats Mativity
BeerID: 898908
Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company
City: Winkburn
Comments: Dark beer with ruby lights and thin, tan top. Aroma has chocolate and caramel
  notes. Taste is similarly malted with the toffee slightly more persistent without
  ever being too sweet. Medium to thin bodied for a stout, smooth texture, average
  carbonation and a lasting malt finish. Pretty good for a Christmas related UK beer.
