| **Comments** | Dark beer with ruby lights and thin, tan top. Aroma has chocolate and caramel notes. Taste is similarly malted with the toffee slightly more persistent without ever being too sweet. Medium to thin bodied for a stout, smooth texture, average carbonation and a lasting malt finish. Pretty good for a Christmas related UK beer. |
