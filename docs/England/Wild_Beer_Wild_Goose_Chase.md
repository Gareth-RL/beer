Brewer: '"Wild Beer (Curious Brewing - St. Peter&#39;s)"'
City: Shepton Mallet
Comments: Tap at Totally Tapped Beeston. Pours pale yellow hazy body white lace top.
  Aroma is hay, barnyard, skunky, - not enticing. Taste is fruity gooseberry rhubarb
  lemon, and hence medium to strong sour after a fleeting light sweetness. Palate
  is medium body, oily feel, average carbonation, bitter finish which is more an aftertaste
  in itself than a lingering finish. Tried again 10/24/17. The aroma was less pungent,
  but the rating stays the same
