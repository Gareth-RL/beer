| **Comments** | Tap at Totally Tapped Beeston. Pours pale yellow hazy body white lace top. Aroma is hay, barnyard, skunky, - not enticing. Taste is fruity gooseberry rhubarb lemon, and hence medium to strong sour after a fleeting light sweetness. Palate is medium body, oily feel, average carbonation, bitter finish which is more an aftertaste in itself than a lingering finish. Tried again 10/24/17. The aroma was less pungent, but the rating stays the same |
