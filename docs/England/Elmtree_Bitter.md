Comments: Poured copper body with off white lace. Aroma has roasted malts and berry
  hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light caramel notes. Palate is medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Classic bitter. I
  realize my palate has become blurred by new world hop pales but this is a pleasant
  bitter.
