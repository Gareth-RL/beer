Comments: '"Cask at the Crown. Smells yeasty and mealy to me. Pours mahogany dark
  with cream scum some lacing. Tastes of roasted malt and heather honey with a great
  tang on the palate. A classic. Bemused that this is my first rating as it’s not
  the first taste. Mild Trail 2019 brings me back and it''s still solid. Mild Trail
  2023 brings a further approving sample Mild Trail 2024 moved the sample from Trent
  Bridge to the Samuel Hall but still a decent brew. Same Trail. Same score"'
