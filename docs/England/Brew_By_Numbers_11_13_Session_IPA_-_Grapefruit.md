| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham and possibly suffering by being preceded by a DIPA. Pours hazy pale gold with white lace halo. Aroma is pine and pith. Taste is medium bitter but there is not much variation from that as the sweetness is fleetness and the sourness is muted. So it&#39;s a bitter pale. Would I want a session of this - on a hot day possibly. Otherwise get yourself a Bitter. |
