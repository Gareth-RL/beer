Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham and possibly suffering by being preceded
  by a DIPA. Pours hazy pale gold with white lace halo. Aroma is pine and pith. Taste
  is medium bitter but there is not much variation from that as the sweetness is fleetness
  and the sourness is muted. So it&#39;s a bitter pale. Would I want a session of
  this - on a hot day possibly. Otherwise get yourself a Bitter."'
