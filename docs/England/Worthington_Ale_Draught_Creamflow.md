Comments: Once all beers were like this where I grew up. It was why CAMRA started. But tasting one today is a shock. Poured reddish amber body white lace top. Not much scent a little malt a hint of hop. Bland taste with a little sweet malt briefly before a long gassy bitter finish  Medium bodied smooth texture gassy and bitter finish which is the peak of the flavour overall. Count your blessings. Unsurprisingly the Beefeater Red lion pub in Bispham has never been in the database
