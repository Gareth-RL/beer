| **Comments** | Pours dark brown with tan lace, diminishing. Aroma has dark fruits, roasted malts, chocolate and citrus notes. Taste is medium sweet with more fruit, some pine hops and a firm platform of roasted malt. Palate is medium bodied, velvety texture, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. I was not sure what to expect from this black IPA but whatever it is, I like it. |
