Comments: '"Exceptionally fragrant. Peanut butter caramel wafer biscuit and chocolate
  all come through. It poured black with thin tan lace dissipating rapidly to halo.
  Taste is medium to full sweetness--a KitKat in a blender. Palate is medium bodied
  smooth and creamy texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish.
  If it were not for the abv I would make this my staple. It''s a beer that wows you."'
