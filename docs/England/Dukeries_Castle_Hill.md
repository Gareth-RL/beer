Comments: 'Cask. Aroma caramelized malts and floral hops. Pours brown amber. White
  top with lacing. Taste is more muted and soured with more hops than malts and leaves
  and grass in the aftertaste. If you like a session bitter that could leave feeling
  like you sucked a hedgerow, this one is for you '
