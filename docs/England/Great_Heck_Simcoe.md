Comments: Beer festival so from barrel tap. Honey brown. Thin lace. Floral aroma and
  fruity hops. The bitter edge of the hop with citrus prominent grows in intensity.
  So it’s a summer ale ideal for a day like today when the sun is high. Having said
  that, it still illustrates the gap between pilsner and pale none of the crispness
  on the palate that our continental brothers are so used to. Instead there is a warmer
  resinous coating on the palate. So a good example of the breed.
