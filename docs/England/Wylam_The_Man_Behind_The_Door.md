Beer: Wylam The Man Behind The Door
BeerID: 575403
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange golden with thin white top. Aroma
  is grapefruit zest mango and pine with a hint of pale malts. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter. Palate is APA like - medium body, oily feel, soft carbonation, bitter,
  but with the muffled antithetical texture to IPA crispness. Okay but they can do
  better.
