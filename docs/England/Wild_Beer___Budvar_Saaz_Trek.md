Beer: Wild Beer / Budvar Saaz Trek
BeerID: 694413
Brewer: '"Wild Beer (Curious Brewing - St. Peter&#39;s)"'
City: Shepton Mallet
Comments: Aroma has dark malts berry fruits and something else lime maybe. Pours chestnut
  with ruby lights and a broken tan lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. The lagering
  seems to lengthen this. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. An interesting hybrid that looks like an ESB but tastes like
  a bock.
