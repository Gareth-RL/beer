| **Comments** | Aroma has dark malts berry fruits and something else lime maybe. Pours chestnut with ruby lights and a broken tan lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. The lagering seems to lengthen this. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. An interesting hybrid that looks like an ESB but tastes like a bock. |
