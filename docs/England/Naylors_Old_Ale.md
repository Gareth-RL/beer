Comments: Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours dark amber with thin
  lace. Aroma is malty but not as much as it should be. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter / sour. Given the abv, there is too little here. Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel average carbonation and a slightly sour finish. Careless occasional
  ale.
