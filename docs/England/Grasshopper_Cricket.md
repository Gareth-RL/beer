Brewer: Grasshopper Brewery (52 Degrees Brewing)
City: Langley Mill
Comments: Cask at The Star Beeston. Aroma is lightly citrus hop and pale malt. Clear
  amber gold body with white lace. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture , average carbonation and a muffled finish not crisp. The most American
  style feature was a malty tang in the finish. 28/11/24 second sipping at the Sir
  John.  Six years later I am less impressed Down from 3.3
