| **Comments** | Nottingham Beer festival 2918. Aroma is more capuccino than espresso. Pours creamy coffee with a tan creamy top above a black body. The taste is medium to full sweet with a light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied light creamy texture soft carbonation with a bitter finish. Possibly too sweet for some but pleasant |
