Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Can from Adventure Beer Co (as I belatedly acknowledge that I really should
  try some more Black Iris. Poured cloudy orange with a big foam top. Aroma has peaches,
  melon, and citrus. Taste is medium sweet to bitter; lactose and fruit in abundance.
  Medium bodied at most, slightly oily feel, average carbonation and a sherbet finish
  as the sweetness fizzes back. To be honest, I was originally keeping the can for
  Halloween due to the wizard etc design but thirst intervened. Happy that it did.
