| **Comments** | Poured amber honey body with fading thin white lace. Aroma had toffee malt and berry fruits with a hint of twiglet. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with malt lingering amidst a bitter hop finish. Palate is medium bodied, some stickiness, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall, this was better than I expected as a mass bottled ESB, and I note that decades ago even some of the cognoscenti liked it well enough. |
