| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours red amber body with white lace head &#40;not your typical wheat beer&#41;. Aroma fruity, edging toward plum, with roasted notes below. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but singularly full grained. Palate is medium bodied, smooth clinging feel, soft carbonation, and a long finish. So much beyond wheat that I forgot it was wheat beer. |
