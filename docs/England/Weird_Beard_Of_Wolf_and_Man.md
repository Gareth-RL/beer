Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours red amber body with white lace
  head &#40;not your typical wheat beer&#41;. Aroma fruity, edging toward plum, with
  roasted notes below. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but singularly full grained.
  Palate is medium bodied, smooth clinging feel, soft carbonation, and a long finish.
  So much beyond wheat that I forgot it was wheat beer."'
