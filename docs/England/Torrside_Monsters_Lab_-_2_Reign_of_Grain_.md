| **Comments** | Pours black with tan lace. Strong aroma of roasted malts with licorice and coffee notes. Taste is medium sweet with toffee and chocolate but sours to licorice and bitterness. Palate is medium body, oily texture, soft to average carbonation and a long finish with a hint of cough medicine. It needs to be more widely available since 3 reviews in 3 years is meagre. Still it worked for me. |
