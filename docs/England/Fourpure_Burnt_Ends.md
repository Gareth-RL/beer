Comments: Keg. Aroma is the smoky side of barbecue with some malty licorice and chocolate
  notes for the connoisseurs. Pours very dark with thin lace ring. Taste is more elusive
  for me. Malts predominate of course but the carbonation does interfere with the
  segmentation of flavours but dark fruit and ashes nestle amidst the caramels. My
  age and provincial upbringing means that a beer that costs £5 should come on clouds
  of glory. There were no clouds but craft in abundance.
