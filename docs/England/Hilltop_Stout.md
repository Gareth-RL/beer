| **Comments** | Aroma is cherry berry fruit which is not typical for stouter. Pours hazy dark brown with tan scummy lace top. Taste is full to medium sweet to light and ashy bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. Overall it's ideal for any stout drinkers who don't like stouts. |
