| **Comments** | Cask. Pours amber with gold lights. Thin white top. The taste is what is known as balanced. One detects bitter hops and toasted malts. Aroma is ever so slightly malt rather than hop. Palate is soft with light carbonation. A session bitter. For a long time I foolishly assumed that this was a sister pub to the Trent Navigation and hence a Navigation pub that had Pedigree et al. as a safety tap for the old guard. But no it’s Marston’s. With a liking for Jennings and Brakspear. Great location and some good live music but the latter eclipse the beer in these craft times. Anyway the bitter is cheap and sessionable. |
