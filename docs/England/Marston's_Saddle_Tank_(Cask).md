Aroma: 6.0
Beer: '"Marston''s Saddle Tank (Cask)"'
BeerID: 13470
Brewer: '"Marston&#39;s (Carlsberg Marston&#39;s Brewing Co.)"'
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Pours amber with gold lights. Thin white top. The taste is what is
  known as balanced. One detects bitter hops and toasted malts. Aroma is ever so slightly
  malt rather than hop. Palate is soft with light carbonation. A session bitter. For
  a long time I foolishly assumed that this was a sister pub to the Trent Navigation
  and hence a Navigation pub that had Pedigree et al. as a safety tap for the old
  guard. But no it’s Marston’s. With a liking for Jennings and Brakspear. Great location
  and some good live music but the latter eclipse the beer in these craft times. Anyway
  the bitter is cheap and sessionable.
