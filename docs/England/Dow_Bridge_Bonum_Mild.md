Comments: ' Cask. Aroma of earthy loam with vinegary undertones. Pours dark chestnut
  with thin gop. Some lacing.  Tastes malty at the front more toasted than caramelized.
  Some peaty notes and a backwash of hops within a thin body light carbonation and
  watery on the palate. Bonum rather than optimum.  '
