| **Comments** | Just lost the review I crafted because I foolishly clicked quick review (be warned!). Can at home. Golden body white foam top. Aroma grapefruit and orange and melon for me so no pineapple or mango discerned. Taste is medium sweet drying to a dusty pine bitterness.  Body is medium, carbonation light, texture oily and finish light and bitter. A session worthy pale although it would not stand out in its crowded market for me. And it would benefit from a warm summer beer garden rather than a December basement. |
