| **Comments**  | Poured cola body no lace at all. Milk chocolate and jam scent. Medium sweet to bitter with digestive biscuits in the mix. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a sticky finish. I guess that is the marshmallow. Surprised that their marshmallow Mild has a higher abv.                                                                                      |
