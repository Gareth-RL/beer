Brewer: New Invention Brewery

Comments: Poured cola body no lace at all. Milk chocolate and jam scent. Medium sweet
  to bitter with digestive biscuits in the mix. Medium bodied smooth texture average
  carbonation and a sticky finish. I guess that is the marshmallow. Surprised that
  their marshmallow Mild has a higher abv.
