Beer: Oldershaw Grantham Stout
BeerID: 5700
Brewer: Zest Brewery (prev Oldershaw Brewery)
City: Barkston
Comments: Cask. Aroma grain with coffee notes lurking. Pours dark with creamy tan
  top and lasting lacing. Tastes toasted malts with chocolate coffee toffee elements
  discernible but only if you concentrate. Medium bodied with a soft finish. A modest
  stout named for a town that has a lot to be modest about.
