| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma grain with coffee notes lurking. Pours dark with creamy tan top and lasting lacing. Tastes toasted malts with chocolate coffee toffee elements discernible but only if you concentrate. Medium bodied with a soft finish. A modest stout named for a town that has a lot to be modest about. |
