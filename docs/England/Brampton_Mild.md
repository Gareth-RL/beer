| **Comments** | Tap at Nottingham beer festival. Aroma richly malty, caramel notes. Pours chestnut dark with thin top. Tastes of toffee and biscuit. Overall a good mild for the winter. 13/06/20 second sipping with sons. They found lots of chocolate in the nose. Ruby lights in the dark brown body. Taste is predominantly bitter, toasted malt, dark fruits. Medium to heavy, mouth-coating, emphatic and cloying, average carbonation, and a bitter, reasonably long finish. It doesn't bottle well apparently  and could be good as a winter warmer. |
