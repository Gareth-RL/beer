Appearance: 4.0

Beer: '"Slater''s Smoked Porter"'
BeerID: 232265
Brewer: '"Slater&#39;s Ales"'
City: Stafford
Comments: Cask. Pours dark chestnut with white bubbly lace top. Aroma fits the name.
  Smokey as a kipper but with sweet caramel malts on top. The taste is more muted,
  although the smoky malt persists appropriately. Some soft berry fruit in there as
  well. Just right to observe what appears to be the equivalent of a stag night for
  Sikhs. You have to love cultural diversity and as a way of ensuring that they are
  not mistaken for Muslims it’s totally effective. 4 ciders and two whiskies to start.
