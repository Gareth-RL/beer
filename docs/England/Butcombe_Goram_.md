| **Comments** | Aroma of berry hops and pale malt. Pours copper with white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied smooth feel average carbonation and a light fruity finish.  Edges towards craft pale but retains cask features. Decent enough but hardly needed except by the brewer. |
