| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is modest some grass, some tea, some faint hint of malt but frankly I donâ€™t like beers that have no excuse for making me work this hard on olfactory functions. It pours honey brown amber with white scummy top. And better still the taste goes well with the chicken and mushroom pie I ordered. Some herbal notes. Overall a beer that was better than it first appeared even if the GK brand machine showed all its sinister features by deciding to delude drinkers that a place specific beer ws actually one big corporate ale. The beer is fine only the concept stinks&#033; |
