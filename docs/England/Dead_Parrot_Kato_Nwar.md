Beer: Dead Parrot Kato Nwar
BeerID: 660314
Brewer: Dead Parrot Beer Co.
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask at the Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours dark mahogany with thin tan
  top. Aroma has coffee and licorice and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter in the finish. But that is the licorice. Palate is medium to light bodied,
  sticky texture, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Pleasant enough
  but the hops are eclipsed so why stress them? And the stout is thinnish when its
  sweetness called for thicker textures.
