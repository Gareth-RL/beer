| **Comments** | Cask at the Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours dark mahogany with thin tan top. Aroma has coffee and licorice and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter in the finish. But that is the licorice. Palate is medium to light bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Pleasant enough but the hops are eclipsed so why stress them? And the stout is thinnish when its sweetness called for thicker textures. |
