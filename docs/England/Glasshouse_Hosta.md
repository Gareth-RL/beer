Comments: 'Poured golden body hazy with thin white head. Aroma citrus and papaya.
  Medium sweet to bitter with more papaya melon and grapefruit pith in the finish.  Medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a mineral dry finish.  If you want
  to know for sure what papaya tastes like, this tells you. '
