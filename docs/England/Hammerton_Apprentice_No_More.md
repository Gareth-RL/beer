| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught. Pours clear golden amber with full white lace top. Aroma has a medley of hop fruits tangerine pineapple and lychee. Melon and mango below in pale malt company. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall I can imagine a session of this pale and my wit at least would sparkle. This apprentice is no Mickey Mouse üê≠. |
