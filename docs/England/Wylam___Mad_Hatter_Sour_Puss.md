BeerID: 533928
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Keg. Aroma has a definite mint note with pineapple set back and some resin,
  skunky, qualities. Pours pale yellow hazy with a circle of thin lace. Taste heavily
  sour, medium bitterness, light sweetness, salty, - certainly a palate freshener.
  I’m under qualified and ambivalent about the sours. I can’t imagine a night of them,
  and they don’t indulge my taste buds the way the dark aromatic stouts do. So still
  a novelty for me.
