Beer: Mill Valley Yorkshire Rose
BeerID: 717844
Brewer: Mill Valley Brewery
City: Hightown
Comments: Aroma is light, some floral hops, melon, and peach notes. Pours slightly
  hazy golden pale with diminishing lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Some fruit
  but like everything about this beer a tad nondescript. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average carbonation and a bitter biscuit finish. So more Yorkshire pale
  than American.
