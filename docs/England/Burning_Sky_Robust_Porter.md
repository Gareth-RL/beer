| **Comments** | Aroma of chocolate coffee dark malts generally. Poured black with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with chocolate and licorice notes. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Very nicely developed dark porter. I could session this. |
