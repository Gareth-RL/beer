BeerID: 683638
Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Aroma has tropical fruit pineapples papaya mango maybe lime. Pours cloudy
  orange golden body and scummy lace. Taste is medium sweet but this rapidly transitions
  to sour bitter herbal flavours. Palate is medium bodied or more, sticky feel, average
  to soft carbonation, and a long complex finish that ranges from sour to sweet. This
  is a beer that grows more interesting. Like people who do the same, cherish it.
