Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: 'Tap at the Canal House. Pours hazy yellow gold with broken white lacing.
  Aroma is grainy malts straw and floral citric hops. Taste is medium to light sweet
  to bitter but this is strongly affected by the creamy texture that got in the way.
  Palate is medium + but with thick feel and average carbonation. The murky finish
  is bitter but undistinguished. I seem unlucky with Buxton. It has a good reputation
  but I seem to pick the ones that challenge it. '
