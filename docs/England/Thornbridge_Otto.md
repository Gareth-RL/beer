Comments: '"Tap. If you like ripe banana and caramel then the smell alone will entice
  you. Pour ruby brown with tan top and broken lacing. The taste is wine gum fruity
  with toffee malts as well. I’m surprised more reviewers haven’t reacted negatively
  to the sweetness but I can also see why. In a measure befitting its octane &#40;8%&#41;
  it’s fun. No sane person would want gallons of this at one time but it pleases well
  along the way."'
