Comments: Poured brown with foam lace top.  Aroma of stone fruit, spice, and cereal. Not the usual Weisse.  Medium sweet to bitter with slight marmalade note alongside banana and grain and yeast. Odd. Medium bodied slightly oily texture average carbonation and a bitter spice finish.  Weird. They are better at stouts. Bottle from brewery
