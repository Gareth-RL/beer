BeerID: 495564
Brewer: Orbit Beers London
City: Walworth
Comments: Tap. Pours copper amber chestnut body, slightly hazy with off-white top.
  Aroma is classic fruit cake. Taste is medium to heavy cloying sweetness, initially
  but this diminishes to a warm but bitter finish. There are dark fruits aplenty although
  whether they are fig or date eludes me. But for those who like their pudding in
  a glass - here we are.
