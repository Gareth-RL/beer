| **Comments** | Cask at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours black with tan lacing.. Aroma has roasted malts resin, cheese, and pleasantly skunky. Taste is superb, beautifully poised between sweet malts and bitter hops. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall far better than I expected and the keg version has more bitterness if you prefer it. |
