| **Comments** | It's supposed to be a seasonal ale with rum and raisin. I was expecting a dark porter but got what looks like an ESB. Not much sign of rum or raisins. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with maybe a hint of dark fruits in the finish. Palate is medium bodied tacky feel average carbonation and a souring finish. Disappointing |
