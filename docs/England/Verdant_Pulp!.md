| **Comments** | Considering it's a DIPA, quite a malty nose but plenty of tropical fruit hops as well. Pours hazy dark golden with white lace. Taste is medium with strengthening bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation, decidedly bitter finish. I expect it is better than I feel.  |
