Comments: '"Considering it''s a DIPA, quite a malty nose but plenty of tropical fruit
  hops as well. Pours hazy dark golden with white lace. Taste is medium with strengthening
  bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation, decidedly
  bitter finish. I expect it is better than I feel. "'
