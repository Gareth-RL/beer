Comments: 'Poured dark brown almost black body with tan lace top. Aroma has definitely
  a spicy note cinnamon and vanilla. Taste reveals the chilies which complicates the
  transition in an interesting way. You go from sweet to bitter more than once. Chocolate
  remains evident the bitter kind.. palate is medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation
  but beware the chili ride. An experiment worth making '
