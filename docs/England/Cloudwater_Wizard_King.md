| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Much to enjoy but maybe over sweet. Aroma has coffee chocolate dark fruit on the nose with Christmas cake and alcohol spice in the mouth. Taste is full sweet with not enough bitter notes to counter. Palate is rich with a lush creamy texture soft carbonation and a long boozy finish. It might be better in a shot glass with dessert. |
