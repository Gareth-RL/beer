| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma has spice and yeast. Taste has medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium or more in terms of body, slick feel, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. This is less yeasty than many witbier. But it is a tricky style. |
