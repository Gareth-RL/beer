| **Comments** | Aroma of pale malts and light grapefruit hop. Pours amber body with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter, dryer than expected. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Fair enough.  07/12/2019 second sipping. Same as above which is fair enough. |
