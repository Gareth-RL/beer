| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma has bread, cereal, nuts, herbs, dough, skunky - a medley as expected. Pours amber gold with a white lace top. Clear. Taste medium sweetness, medium bitterness, salty, and a singular malty taste in the finish. Palate medium body, thick feel, soft carbonation, long finish. Not a Tripel drinker on a regular basis. Sometimes I have to stand upright for hours at a time. |
