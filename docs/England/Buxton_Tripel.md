Beer: Buxton Tripel
BeerID: 395077
Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: Bottle. Aroma has bread, cereal, nuts, herbs, dough, skunky - a medley as
  expected. Pours amber gold with a white lace top. Clear. Taste medium sweetness,
  medium bitterness, salty, and a singular malty taste in the finish. Palate medium
  body, thick feel, soft carbonation, long finish. Not a Tripel drinker on a regular
  basis. Sometimes I have to stand upright for hours at a time.
