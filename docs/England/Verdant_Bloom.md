| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale orange with white lace mostly lasting at the fringe. Aroma has pale bread malt beneath a profusion of floral citrus hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a light sour edge. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation, and a rich finish. I upped it a point just for the way the wash of a swallow glitters on the tongue. Very good of its type. But blueberries come on?&#033; |
