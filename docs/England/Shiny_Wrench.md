| **Comments** | Tap. As pungent a malty stout as one could wish. Coffee predominates with licorice lurking. Taste takes a while to unpack from its mild malt loaf beginnings but alongside its molasses thereâ€™s dark fruit and just a hint of cough syrup. The biscuit remains on the palate like a sleeping hound. Good stuff. But one to end the evening 05/98/24 second sipping 7years later.  Still full of malty goodness but not taking my own advice as there is another beer to follow  |
