| **Comments** | Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours dark chestnut body creamy top. Aroma is caramel malts and sweet fruit notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied slick texture average carbonation and a long finish. A decent porter but I don&#39;t taste the port myself  |
