Brewer: Track Brewing Co.
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap. Great scent - a citrus kick of lemon grapefruit and tangerines. Pours
  hazy even cloudy yellow with a tight white lace top. Taste is more citrus but with
  an interesting fluctuation on the palate from sour to sweet. Sour as in grapefruit
  zest and sweet as in tangerine. Medium carbonation and a lasting complex finish.
  As I write the grade goes higher.
