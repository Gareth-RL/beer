Comments: '"The familiar tropical aromatic explosion - mango to the fore. Pours hazy
  orange golden body with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet with some sour notes but
  quite a slow and limited transition; the sweetness sticks. Palate is medium bodied,
  clammy feel, soft to average carbonation, juicy persistence leading to a sour finish.
  If you drink NEIPA as a substitute for fruit juice, fill your fridge. But this isn''t
  their best."'
