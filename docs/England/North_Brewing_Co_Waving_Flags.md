Comments: '"Aroma is fruity and if your nose has exotic affinities it''s lychees and
  mango, but for plebs like me it''s gooseberry and citrus. Pours murky yellow grey
  as any NEIPA might be. Taste is medium sweet to sour.  Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel soft to average carbonation and a sour fruit finish. Okay."'
