Comments: '"Some confusion as to style as it was once an IPA and is now amber according
  to the clip but doesn''t seem to fit other Red ales. Aroma of toffee malts. Pours
  golden amber with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but the
  malts have it.  Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish. Decent enough but hardly explosive."'
