Comments: 'Pours reddish body light pink lacing. Aroma has the promise of raspberries
  and maybe a lactic note. Taste is definitely sweet and fruity with lime confined
  to the background. Palate is thin to medium bodied, watery feel, average to soft
  carbonation and the sweetness subsides but is never replaced. '
