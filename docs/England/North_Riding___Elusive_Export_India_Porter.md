Beer: North Riding / Elusive Export India Porter
BeerID: 690883
Brewer: North Riding Brewery
City: Snainton
Comments: Aroma has caramel toffee malt. Pours dark body creamy tan top. Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter with fruity notes. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture
  average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A very satisfactory porter with
  good complexity and lets face it if you find complexity it had better be the good
  kind.
