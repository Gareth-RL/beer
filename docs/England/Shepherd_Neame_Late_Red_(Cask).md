| **Comments** | Cask. Pours amber with ruby lights and foam off white top. Aroma is bread cereal malt with light herbal notes. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sweet and then sour in the finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture, average carbonation, astringent finish. Overall a forgettable bitter. |
