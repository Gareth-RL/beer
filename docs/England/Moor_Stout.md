| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma roasted malts coffee and a hint of tobacco smoke. Pours clear black body tan creamy top. Taste is light sweet and medium bitter. Texture oily and carbonation soft. A decent solid stout on yet another wet day. 23/11/24 second sipping.  All of the above remains true. And that includes the weather. |
