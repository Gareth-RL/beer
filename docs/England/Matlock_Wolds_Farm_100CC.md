| **Comments** | Bottle delivered by Adventure Beer Company which seems to be offering a wider range of east Midlands ales. Pours clear golden body with full white foam lace top. Aroma has some bread malts but the citrus hops are there too. This is more pronounced in the taste with grapefruit and orange evident. Hence the initial sweetness is rapidly supplanted by a growing hoppy bitterness. I am somewhat wary when a local cask producer ventures towards the American styles, but taken as a golden ale as much as an American pale, this is very drinkable. If only it were possible to have a sociable session --ideally with some sunshine! |
