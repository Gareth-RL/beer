| **Comments** | Brought back for the Euros. Since we don't win anything we commemorate injuries. Golden body white lace top.  Aroma of hop fruits.  Medium sweet to bitter but with an unpleasant sour aftertaste.  Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and long finish (see above). It doesn't bode well  |
