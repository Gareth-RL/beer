| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours espresso black with tan foam ring. Aroma richly roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is medium to full sweet then medium bitter with a sustained chocolate note. Palate medium to full with creamy feel average or more carbonation and a long finish. Certainly a beer to savour. |
