| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body with white lace. Aroma caramel malts.taste medium sweet to bitter. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nicely caramelized malts but even at 7.5 the alcohol creeps through. Not their regular output. Infinity is more reliable |
