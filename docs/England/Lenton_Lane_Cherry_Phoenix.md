Comments: '"Poured rich amber body off white lace top. Aroma has the promised cherries.
  Medium sweet to sour with lasting cherry infusion. Medium bodied clammy texture,
  average to soft carbonation and a sour finish. A Kriek it isn''t - more Titanic
  plum oorter territory although that flatters."'
