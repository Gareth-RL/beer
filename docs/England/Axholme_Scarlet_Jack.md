| **Comments** | Cask. Lightly spiced sweet malt scent. Pours maple syrup brown with thin top diminishing lace. Taste is not as sweet as the pumpkin maple combination might lead some to fear. The finish is bitter and the palate is light. Overall a solid brown ale with none of the Halloween disadvantages&#033; |
