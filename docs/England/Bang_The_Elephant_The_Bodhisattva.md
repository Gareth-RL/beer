| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden with white foam head. Strong citrus mango aroma. Medium sweet to lightly sour/bitter with grapefruit, papaya, and mandarin notes. Medium bodied, smooth texture. average carbonation, and a finish that starts sour but finishes bitter in a lime kind of way. I took the trouble of inputting the wonderfully over-the-top can description. It might make you want to see the movie, although it says little about the Buddhist significance of the Bodhisattva, or perhaps more importantly, the hop and malt types selected. Still I am happy to trumpet the Elephant's virtues and if Nirvana can be reached by beer alone, I am on the path. |
