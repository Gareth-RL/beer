Beer: '"Harvey''s Sussex XX Mild / Sussex Dark Mild "'
BeerID: 4371
Brewer: '"Harvey&#39;s Brewery"'
City: Lewes
Comments: Cask. Pours dark amber with creamy foam head. Aroma has bread and nuts.
  Taste has a fruitier quality with a satisfying mix of hop berries and soft carbonation
  to give a pleasant languor. As with many old-fashioned Mild ale, it shows what a
  low abv can still yield.
