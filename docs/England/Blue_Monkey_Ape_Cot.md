| **Comments** | Pours clear golden copper with thin lace top. Aroma muted pale malts and softly apricot and hop, especially in the finish. Taste is medium bitter to sweet. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation. Overall, the Ape doesn&#39;t really need apricot but I guess the contrast lengthened the finish. |
