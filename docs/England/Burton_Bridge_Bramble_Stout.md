Comments: 'This is a beer that divides the cognoscenti. Some rare positive Scandinavian
  reviews and some dismissal in the UK. Poured dark brown body tan washed lace. Aroma
  berry hop and dark malts. Medium sweet to bitter with just a hint of blackcurrant
  rather than blackberry. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish. Perfectly decent stout but hard to place structurally. After all
  who requires a blackberry? But it dragged me off the Mild Trail '
