| **Comments** | This is a beer that divides the cognoscenti. Some rare positive Scandinavian reviews and some dismissal in the UK. Poured dark brown body tan washed lace. Aroma berry hop and dark malts. Medium sweet to bitter with just a hint of blackcurrant rather than blackberry. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Perfectly decent stout but hard to place structurally. After all who requires a blackberry? But it dragged me off the Mild Trail  |
