Comments: '"Poured coffee brown with scummy top. Aroma dark malts  red berry hint
  of licorice. Taste is medium sweet which persists into a bitter finish. Quite a
  mélange of flavours but good. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and
  a bitter finish. Never sure of the type, but this is a superior sample. Hope there''s
