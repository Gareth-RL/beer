| **Comments** | Poured coffee brown with scummy top. Aroma dark malts  red berry hint of licorice. Taste is medium sweet which persists into a bitter finish. Quite a m√©lange of flavours but good. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Never sure of the type, but this is a superior sample. Hope there's more collaboration  |
