Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: B&T Dragons Gold
BeerID: 45765
Brewer: B&T Brewery
City: Shefford
Comments: Cask. Judging by reviews from those whose judgment I respect, this is a
  beer that divides opinion. Aroma has some quality mandarin and orange peel is actually
  there. Appearance is orange copper body and white lace top mostly lasting. Taste
  is full bodied with bread malts balancing the fruit and a bitter finish. I think
  both Beowulf and Grendel would approve.
