| **Comments** | Cask. Judging by reviews from those whose judgment I respect, this is a beer that divides opinion. Aroma has some quality mandarin and orange peel is actually there. Appearance is orange copper body and white lace top mostly lasting. Taste is full bodied with bread malts balancing the fruit and a bitter finish. I think both Beowulf and Grendel would approve. |
