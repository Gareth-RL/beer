Brewer: Heritage Brewing Co. (inc William Worthington Brewery)
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Aroma bread, nuts, ginger, woody, Pours amber with thin white top.
  Taste medium sweet fading to medium strong bitter. Certainly has a bitter tang.
  Tastes more like an ESB than a pale to me. I guess the horse ate the apple that
  the brewer promises.
