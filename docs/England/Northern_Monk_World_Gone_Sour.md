| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange amber with thin lace top. Aroma has grapefruit pith melon and lemon. Taste is medium bitter to sour as the lemon juice intensified. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, and an astringent finish. Refreshing albeit somewhat tongue curling. |
