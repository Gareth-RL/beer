| **Comments** | Pours very pale golden with white lace top. Slightly saccharin scent atop the citrus hop. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a modest lengthening. Palate is  light to watery bodied. Average carbonation. Slightly mineral mouth feel and bitter finish. Surprised to find one I missed. |
