| **Comments** | Poured cola black thin lace diminishing to halo. Aroma coffee malts. Taste medium sweet to bitter with long coffee note and backnote of chocolate. Medium to thin body smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Always slightly alarmed by the implications of a breakfast stout but this is a temptation. |
