Comments: Poured cola black thin lace diminishing to halo. Aroma coffee malts. Taste
  medium sweet to bitter with long coffee note and backnote of chocolate. Medium to
  thin body smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Always
  slightly alarmed by the implications of a breakfast stout but this is a temptation.
