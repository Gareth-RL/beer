Comments: '"Aroma of grassy resinous hops and pale malt.  Pours amber gold with white
  lace top. Taste is lightly sweet to piney bitter. Quite a sharp transition. Palate
  is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Altbier
  isn''t my domain, but if you like bitter pales it suits."'
