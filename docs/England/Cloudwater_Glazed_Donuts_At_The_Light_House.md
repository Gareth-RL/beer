| **Comments** | Aroma of grassy resinous hops and pale malt.  Pours amber gold with white lace top. Taste is lightly sweet to piney bitter. Quite a sharp transition. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Altbier isn't my domain, but if you like bitter pales it suits. |
