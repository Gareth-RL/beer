| **Comments** | Poured ruby brown clear bodied with off white lace top. Aroma of dark malt and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet with light bitter chocolate note. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. There's a swirl of blackberry too so it's session worthy. |
