| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark brown with dark tan halo top. Aroma praline chocolate with cherries. Taste is  medium to full sweet with bitter chocolate notes. Palate is medium to full, feel is creamy, carbonation is soft to average, and finish is long and still sweet. If one orders a Black Forest Imperial Stout then one should be unsurprised by its sweetness but like the gateau a little goes a long way. |
