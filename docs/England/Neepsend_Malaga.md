Comments: 'The scent tells the story - chocolate and raisins. Reminiscent for summer
  of snacks at the pictures. Pours dark brown body with tan cream lace top. Taste
  is chocolate run and raisins so very sweet to start and then bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Aroma is great
  but taste is too raw '
