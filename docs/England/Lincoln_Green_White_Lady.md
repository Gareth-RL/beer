Comments: @SirJohnBorlaseWarren. Poured clear pale yellow gold body white lace top. Aroma of wood and citrus hops. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruit and pale hop, maybe a hint of mango. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Not bad for the new batch of beers
