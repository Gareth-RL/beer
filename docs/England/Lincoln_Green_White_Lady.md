Comments: '"@SirJohnBorlaseWarren. Poured clear pale yellow gold body white lace top.
  Aroma of wood and citrus hops. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruit and pale hop,
  maybe a hint of mango. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. Not bad for the new batch of beers "'
