Beer: Beer Ink Curd Your Enthusiasm
BeerID: 748893
Brewer: Beer Ink Brewing
City: Lindley
Comments: Pours murky orange golden with thin lace halo. Lactic initial scent with
  lemon background. Taste is medium sour with intermittent fruit sweetness but it
  delivers on the sourness. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to soft
  carbonation and a sour cream finish. Certainly refreshing, but a little could go
  a long way.
