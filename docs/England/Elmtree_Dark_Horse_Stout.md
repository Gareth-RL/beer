Comments: '"Bottle. Poured Dark brown body thin lace rapidly diminishing. Aroma of
  roasted malts coffee and a hint of dark fruit. Taste is lightly sweet to medium
  bitter so a stout that does not linger on the sweet side of the spectrum. Palate
  is light to medium bodied, smooth enough if edging the watery, average carbonation,
  and a long bitter finish. A stout you can trust as long as you don''t have a sweet
  tooth."'
