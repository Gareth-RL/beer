Comments: '"Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy golden pale orange with
  white lace top. Aroma has spice fruit and banana wheat yeast so as the Saison that
  followed a Wheat beer, this leaves me utterly confused. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture like banana peel. Carbonation
  is soft to flat, and the finish is very banana bread. Bewildered. I&#39;m still
  getting some banana yeasty wheat beer notes in this so the bewilderment is lasting.
