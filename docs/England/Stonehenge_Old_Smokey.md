| **Comments** | Cask. Dark brown. Thick tan head. Earthy aroma. Pleasantl, swet caramel malt foreground with one raisin notes within. No chocolate or coffee conspicuous and the licorice is understated. Given the dark character and abv, the body is medium rather than full, and more watery than resinous on the palate. If this is a January -February seasonal ale, I may regret drinking it in late September on draft. |
