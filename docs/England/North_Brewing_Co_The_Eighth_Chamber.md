Beer: North Brewing Co The Eighth Chamber
BeerID: 930658
Brewer: North Brewing Co (England)
City: Leeds
Comments: Can to take away. Pours amber golden body frothy lace top. Aroma of citrus,
  melon and pine. Taste is medium sweet with some orange marmalade notes and hints
  of grapefruit. This eases the transition to a medium bitter finish. Palate is also
  medium bodied, average carbonation, a little drying in the mouth and a bitter finish.
  By my reckoning a very solid American style IPA
