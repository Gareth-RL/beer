| **Comments** | Vanilla malt notes. Poured amber golden body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet with white chocolate note alongside vanilla and lactose so not for the sour toothed. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish if you can extract it from the other sweeter notes around it. The mystery of white stout's raisin d'etre remains. |
