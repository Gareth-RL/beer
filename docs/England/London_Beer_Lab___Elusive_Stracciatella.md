Comments: '"Vanilla malt notes. Poured amber golden body with white lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet with white chocolate note alongside vanilla and lactose so not for
  the sour toothed. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a light
  bitter finish if you can extract it from the other sweeter notes around it. The
  mystery of white stout''s raisin d''etre remains."'
