BeerID: 791677
Brewer: Brew By Numbers
City: Greenwich
Comments: Poured hazy golden body with thin lace top. Pithy citrus with melon note.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Decent melony transition. Palate is medium bodied
  smooth texture soft to average carbonation. As someone who is not always convinced
  by the DDH claim, this was persuasive.
