| **Comments** | Bottle at the Overdraught. Pours golden body with white lacing. Aroma has pale malts pithy citrus and pine. Taste is medium sweet to crisply bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. A perfectly respectable IPA and well balanced. Maybe Manchester and Sheffield should put on a northern powerhouse beer festival? 16/06/18 It&#39;s almost always tap for me. Bottles are gifts or oddities and this is neither. I should have gone for the Milvus. |
