| **Comments** | Salted caramel stout. Pours dark brown body and tan lace top.  Aroma has dark caramelized malts with a pleasant berry buzz. Taste is medium sweet and lasting with a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, silky smooth texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. They are brewers to follow. |
