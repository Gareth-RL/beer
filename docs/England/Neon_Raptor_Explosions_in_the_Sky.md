Comments: Aroma has some citrus grapefruit grassy hops. Pours murky gold with thin
  lace scummy. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a solid NEIPA which makes
  me wonder about its relationship to Cube Farm. But a beer and brewer to rely on
