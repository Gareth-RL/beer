| **Comments** | Aroma has some citrus grapefruit grassy hops. Pours murky gold with thin lace scummy. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a solid NEIPA which makes me wonder about its relationship to Cube Farm. But a beer and brewer to rely on |
