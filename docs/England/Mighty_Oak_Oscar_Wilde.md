Comments: Cask. Embankment Nottingham as part of the mild trail. Aroma roast coffee
  and dark malt. Pours dark with thin lace top. Taste gas hints of liquorice but mainly
  malted notes with a bitter finish. One wonders if Wilde would appreciate his demotion
  from world wit to Cockney rhyming slang?
