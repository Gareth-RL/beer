Comments: '"Considering it''s been around since 2019, it has eluded me. Definite citrus
  scent but mainly mandarin and grapefruit for me. Medium sweet to sour with promised
  lemon/ melon finish. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and
  a fruity finish. Surprised it''s not a regular offering "'
