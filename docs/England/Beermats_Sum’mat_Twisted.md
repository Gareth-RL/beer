| **Comments**  | Considering it's been around since 2019, it has eluded me. Definite citrus scent but mainly mandarin and grapefruit for me. Medium sweet to sour with promised lemon/ melon finish. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a fruity finish. Surprised it's not a regular offering                                                                                       |
