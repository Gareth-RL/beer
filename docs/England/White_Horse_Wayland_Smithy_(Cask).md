BeerID: 43452
Brewer: White Horse Brewery
City: Faringdon
Comments: Cask. Pours amber with thin white top. Aroma of hop soft fruits and undertones
  of caramel. Taste more immediately bitter and has a sour mash quality with a definite
  acrid edge in the aftertaste. It wouldn’t be my choice for the evening but it wakes
  up the senses.
