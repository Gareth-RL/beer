| **Comments** | Pleasant toffee scent of malts. Dark brown creamy lasting top. Smooth caramel notes give a pleasant foundation for an easy drinking porter. Bitter tang in the background. The pick of the core LG range.  2 march 2019 stout and porter stroll so an excuse to revisit old favourites. Still easy drinking and smooth but it might dip a point on aroma. There are so many pungent porters now. 21/11/19 thinner than I recall. 28/01/20 back to its best. 13/03/2024  always my safest choice  |
