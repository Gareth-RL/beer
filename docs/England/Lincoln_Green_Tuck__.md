Comments: 'Pleasant toffee scent of malts. Dark brown creamy lasting top. Smooth caramel
  notes give a pleasant foundation for an easy drinking porter. Bitter tang in the
  background. The pick of the core LG range.  2 march 2019 stout and porter stroll
  so an excuse to revisit old favourites. Still easy drinking and smooth but it might
  dip a point on aroma. There are so many pungent porters now. 21/11/19 thinner than
  I recall. 28/01/20 back to its best. 13/03/2024  always my safest choice '
