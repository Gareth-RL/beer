| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy murky pale orange with off white lace. Aroma has citrus, grassy and melon rind. Palate is medium bodied with oily texture and soft carbonation, bitter finish. Taste is bitter sour fruit but with lots to enjoy for the abv. Overall a creditable table beer. |
