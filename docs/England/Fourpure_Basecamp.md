Comments: '"Poured very pale straw golden body with white lace top diminishing to
  . Aroma has grass and light citric notes. Not spicy to my nostrils. Taste is medium
  sweet to crisply bitter. Second sip seemed to give more fruit than the first but
  both mellowed to a pleasant bitter finish. It''s a lager so I was not expecting
  to be overwhelmed, but it is easy drinking and should go well in the summer."'
