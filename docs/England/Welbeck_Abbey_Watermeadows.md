| **Comments** | Poured clear golden white lace wash. Aroma has very light grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with not a lot going on. Bland is too big a word. Although I did detect some tea; Palate is thin watery average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Labeled Spring, maybe it will taste better in a month or two  |
