| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has roasty, toasty, malts citrus hops. Pours clear amber with full white foam top. Taste is medium with initial bitterness sweetening and then ebbing away. Palate is medium to full due to thick feel, carbonation average, and it certainly leaves a film of something and not in a good way. I suspect this is the lowest rating  that I have given to the skilled brewers of Somerset. Let it be a lesson to us all. 24/11/21 second sipping. Keg. Residual film that marred the first tasting has disappeared. Still a malty pale. |
