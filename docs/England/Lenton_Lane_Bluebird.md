Comments: '"Cask. Pours pale gold yellow with little head to speak of. Aroma &#40;at
  least for me&#41; was off-putting. Vacillating between lychee and sweet pee &#40;and
  that is not a misspelling&#41;.&#41; The taste was similarly confusing with sweet
  notes and herbal undertones. Light bodied with some carbonation in the finish but
  not for me "'
