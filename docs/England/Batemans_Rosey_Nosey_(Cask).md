| **Comments** | Poured dark chestnut body thin lace top.  Medium sweet to bitter with caramel malt berry hops and Xmas spice. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Amazed I have never reviewed before.  By the low bar of seasonal beer in England,  this is better than many  |
