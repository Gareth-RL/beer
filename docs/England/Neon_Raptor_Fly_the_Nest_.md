| **Comments** | Tap at the Neon Raptor taproom Nottingham. Pours hazy pale with thin lace top. Aroma has tropical citrus hop and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and sour in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average to soft carbonation and a lightly sour finish. A collaboration with Cuckoo and very easy drinking. |
