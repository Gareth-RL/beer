| **Comments**  | Ever wondered what mango and papaya smell like? This. Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Sweet to lightly bitter very fruit forward pale and the finish is murky rather than crisp. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light less sweet finish. I liked it                                                                                       |
