| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours dark chestnut with cream tan foam head. Aroma has herbs, raisin, banana, caramel, almost cherry. Such are the eccentricities of scent. Taste is medium to full sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, smooth textured, average carbonation and too cold. The finish is bitter, but modest. Overall a good example of why porter delivers. |
