Comments: '"Bottle from Adventure. Pours ruby chestnut body tan foam top. Aroma has
  berry hops and dark malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. I can''t say the toffee
  malt came through for me. There was more fruit than caramel. Medium to full bodied,
  smooth texture but over carbonated which interfered with the finish and palate generally"'
