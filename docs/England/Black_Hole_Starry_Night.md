| **Comments** | Poured ruby copper body off white lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with roasted malts to the fore and bitter hop finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  You don't often see a ruby bitter as description compared to ruby Mild say. But decent enough  |
