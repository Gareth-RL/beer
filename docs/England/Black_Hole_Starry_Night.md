Comments: '"Poured ruby copper body off white lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts and
  berry hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with roasted malts to the fore and bitter hop
  finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  You
  don''t often see a ruby bitter as description compared to ruby Mild say. But decent
  enough "'
