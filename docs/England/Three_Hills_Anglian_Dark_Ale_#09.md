| **Comments** | Aroma has berty fruit and roasted malts. Pours murky dark brown with tan this lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. I suspect the most damning thing is that it's a keg ale that tastes like cask. |
