| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours golden amber with white lace top. Aroma has floral, grass, herbs, on the hop front and the barest hint of pale malt. Continuous hopping indeed. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied,oily feel, average carbonation and a residual sweet hop finish. I was thrown initially by the ruby ale description on the board here. Odd, they are usually meticulous. |
