| **Comments** | Honored to review it first and the aroma draws you in with its coffee toffee chocolate malt scent. Pours dark with brown tan top diminishing to halo. Taste is predictably medium sweet at least with background bitterness. Palate is medium bodied with quite a modest stickiness although the lactose is definitely there. Carbonation is average and the finish lingers trying to decide if it wants to let go of the sweetness and settle in the dark chocolate. I liked it but then again I like porter and sweetness. Hell, I really liked Titanic Plum when I first had it. So lets expect some descent but for anyone who went from wine gums to beer, this works. |
