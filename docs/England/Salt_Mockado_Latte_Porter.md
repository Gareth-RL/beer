Comments: Honored to review it first and the aroma draws you in with its coffee toffee
  chocolate malt scent. Pours dark with brown tan top diminishing to halo. Taste is
  predictably medium sweet at least with background bitterness. Palate is medium bodied
  with quite a modest stickiness although the lactose is definitely there. Carbonation
  is average and the finish lingers trying to decide if it wants to let go of the
  sweetness and settle in the dark chocolate. I liked it but then again I like porter
  and sweetness. Hell, I really liked Titanic Plum when I first had it. So lets expect
  some descent but for anyone who went from wine gums to beer, this works.
