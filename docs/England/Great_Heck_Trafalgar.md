Brewer: Great Heck Brewing
City: Goole
Comments: Cask at the Sir John Gervase Warren. Pours pale gold yellow with white lace
  top. Aroma skunky, not at all what I expected but the beer itself is fine. Taste
  is medium bitter after a light sweet fruity start. The finish is unspectacular and
  owes more to pale malts than Columbus hops. The latter does not excuse the name.
  It just reflects a fleeting web search. A Hispaniola of a beer.
