| **Comments** | Cask at The Organ Grinder. Pours clear pale gold with white lace top. Aroma has grapefruit pith and bread malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Another Oakham hoppy special, but it is a bit of a one string instrument for me. But fine on a sunny Sunday afternoon. |
