Beer: Oakham Tranquility
BeerID: 125010
Brewer: Oakham Ales
City: Peterborough
Comments: Cask at The Organ Grinder. Pours clear pale gold with white lace top. Aroma
  has grapefruit pith and bread malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is
  medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Another
  Oakham hoppy special, but it is a bit of a one string instrument for me. But fine
  on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
