Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Quantock Plastered Pheasant
BeerID: 135315
Brewer: Quantock Brewery
City: Bishops Lydeard
Comments: Cask. Malt and plum aroma. Pours a very attractive ruby chestnut with cream
  tan top. Taste has dark fruit and may be some caramelized notes but the taste rapidly
  stakes rather opening up. The finish is thus more abruptly sour than bitter. A beer
  that promises but doesn’t fulfil its potential. A bit like pheasant in my experience.
