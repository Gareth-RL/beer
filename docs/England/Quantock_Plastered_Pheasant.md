| **Comments** | Cask. Malt and plum aroma. Pours a very attractive ruby chestnut with cream tan top. Taste has dark fruit and may be some caramelized notes but the taste rapidly stakes rather opening up. The finish is thus more abruptly sour than bitter. A beer that promises but doesnâ€™t fulfil its potential. A bit like pheasant in my experience. |
