Brewer: Manning Brewers
City: Congleton
Comments: Cask. Aroma is malty. bread, nuts, hay, in that order. It pours the golden
  side of amber white lace. It should be admitted that I have a soft spot for the
  session bitter so this is playing on a favorable pitch. I can imagine an evening
  of pleasant conversation accompanied by this. And the next day would work too. Medium
  bitter with some woody notes. And a classic bitter finish on the hops. Not great
  but ever so solid.
