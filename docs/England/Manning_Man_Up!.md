| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is malty. bread, nuts, hay, in that order. It pours the golden side of amber white lace. It should be admitted that I have a soft spot for the session bitter so this is playing on a favorable pitch. I can imagine an evening of pleasant conversation accompanied by this. And the next day would work too. Medium bitter with some woody notes. And a classic bitter finish on the hops. Not great but ever so solid. |
