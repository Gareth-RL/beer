| **Comments** | Cask. Pours ruby dark chestnut with bubbly tan head. Vanilla barely present in the aroma which is malty and biscuity with toast notes. Taste brings the vanilla out but in a subdued and subtle way; smooth rather than cloying. Medium to full in term of languor on the palate where some bitter rind taste cuts through. Interesting, if not quite a match for Dark Drake. |
