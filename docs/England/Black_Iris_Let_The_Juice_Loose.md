Comments: Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky orange dark amber with off white
  lacing. Aroma has pale malt and peachy citrus hop. Taste is lightly sweet and then
  increasingly astringent and bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft
  to flat carbonation, and a long finish. They can and do do better.
