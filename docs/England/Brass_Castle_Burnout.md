| **Comments** | Cask at the Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream top. Aroma has ashy smoke and roasted malts that for me concealed the coffee and licorice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite smoky finish. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation and a bitter ash finish. Overall, better than it sounds and true to its label. Smoked. |
