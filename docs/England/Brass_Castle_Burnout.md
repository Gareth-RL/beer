Beer: Brass Castle Burnout
BeerID: 221229
Brewer: Brass Castle Brewery
City: Malton
Comments: Cask at the Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours black with tan cream top. Aroma
  has ashy smoke and roasted malts that for me concealed the coffee and licorice.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite smoky finish. Palate is medium bodied,
  creamy texture, soft carbonation and a bitter ash finish. Overall, better than it
  sounds and true to its label. Smoked.
