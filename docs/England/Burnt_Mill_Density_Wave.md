| **Comments** | Aroma has the coffee and caramelized malts. Pours dark brown body virtually black with tan lace. Aroma has sweet coffee notes and a vanilla quality. Taste is sweet and I like it. Palate is medium bodied smooth feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. One wave should follow another. 29/11)19 second sipping very good porter |
