Beer: Neon Raptor Never Forget Your Amethyst
BeerID: 599491
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap. Pours dark almost black body and thin lace top. Aroma is chocolate
  heading towards Turkish delight. Taste is sweet to bitter with surprising mint finish.
  Palate is medium to full bodied, texture is creamy, carbonation soft, and long finish.
  So this should be in the Christmas range. The more sips I took the more mint and
  the less Turkish delight I could find. Weird.
