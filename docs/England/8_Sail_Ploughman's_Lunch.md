| **Comments**  | Clear golden body white lace top. Aroma flour malts and hop fruit. Not great taste bland if anything and maybe more pale malt than hops. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Maybe it tastes better with cheese                                                                                       |
