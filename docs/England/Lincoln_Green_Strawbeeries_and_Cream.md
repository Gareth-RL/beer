Comments: Cask. Definite strawberry icecream scent. Pours yellow gold with white lace.
  Taste is rather overwhelmed by the sweetness of the strawberry cream additives.
  But you get what you asked for. A summer beer. When Alco pop is not available. 09/07/19
  second sipping well Wimbledon is on. And I look older than John McEnroe and I am
  NOT. If strawberries do something for you then rest assured they do something to
  this beer. And as a gimmick it does its job.
