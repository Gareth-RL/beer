Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee body and tan cream top. Aroma
  is a rich mix of coffee toffee licorice and dark fruits &#40;8 is not excessive&#41;.
  Taste is similarly rich with medium to full sweetness amidst an obvious alcoholic
  bath. Palate is medium to full, creamy texture, more hot chocolate than cream itself
  , carbonation average to soft, and a long finish. Definitely a beer to end on like
  the perfect dessert ends a meal. This satisfied my inner beast."'
