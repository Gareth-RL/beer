| **Comments** | Aroma has some citrus and pineapple but less than some of their other NEIPAs. But murky golden, thin lace in classic style. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but some mineral notes in the finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a chalky finish. In the taproom it's listed as a session IPA but I would definitely prefer a session of Virtual Paradise which is their DDH 4.5% pale. |
