| **Comments** | Spicey fruitcake aroma. Poured dark mahogany body with tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with nutmeg and cinnamon evident. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long spicy finish. Tis the season, but not bad for British Christmas beer which is often dire. |
