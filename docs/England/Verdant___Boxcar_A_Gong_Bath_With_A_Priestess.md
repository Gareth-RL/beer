Brewer: Verdant Brewing Co

Comments: Aroma has citrus hops and caramel malts. Pours murky hazy amber with off
  white lace. Taste is medium sweet with a strong fruit note and even a hint of chocolate.
  Palate is medium bodied oily to clammy feel, average to soft carbonation and a smooth
  finish. One of the beat brown ales I have tasted recently.
