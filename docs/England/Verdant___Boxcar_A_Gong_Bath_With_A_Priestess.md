| **Comments** | Aroma has citrus hops and caramel malts. Pours murky hazy amber with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet with a strong fruit note and even a hint of chocolate. Palate is medium bodied oily to clammy feel, average to soft carbonation and a smooth finish. One of the beat brown ales I have tasted recently. |
