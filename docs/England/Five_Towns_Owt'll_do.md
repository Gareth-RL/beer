Comments: '"Cask at the Vat and Fiddle Nottingham. Pours dark body tan cream top.
  Aroma is malty with coffee notes. If you concentrate hard the rum appears. Taste
  is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average
  carbonation, and a bitter finish. More going on than in some Mild I&#39;ve tasted."'
