| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body and tan cream lace. Aroma lactose sweet more cream than milky. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some chocolate malts emerging from the milking. Medium bodied slightly sticky especially in the finish. Light bitter finish and average carbonation. Decent stuff. |
