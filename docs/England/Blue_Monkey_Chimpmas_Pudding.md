| **Comments** | Cask. A Christmas variant on their Winter Wolly by my guess. Aroma has toffee malts and spice. Pours dark ruby copper with off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour and bitter. And the allspice is not too distracting. Palate is medium bodied, thick sticky texture, average carbonation, and a soft souring languor. Given the parlous quality of most festive ales in England this is excellent. |
