BeerID: 577236
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. A Christmas variant on their Winter Wolly by my guess. Aroma has toffee
  malts and spice. Pours dark ruby copper with off white lace top. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly sour and bitter. And the allspice is not too distracting. Palate
  is medium bodied, thick sticky texture, average carbonation, and a soft souring
  languor. Given the parlous quality of most festive ales in England this is excellent.
