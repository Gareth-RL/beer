| **Comments** | Poured amber body with off white lace top. Aroma has biscuit malts and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit forward but a sharpening bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A hell of a name for a classic bitter. |
