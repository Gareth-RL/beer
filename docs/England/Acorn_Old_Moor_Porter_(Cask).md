Comments: Dark malty nose with coffee vying with licorice notes. Poured dark mahogany
  body and tan cream lace. Taste is medium bitter with some dark fruit balance. Palate
  is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long finish. This is well
  made stuff and decently cellared it could be a session ale.
