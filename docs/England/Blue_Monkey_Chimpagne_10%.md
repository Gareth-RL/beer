Comments: '"Cask. Aroma heavily malted. Pours amber with white bubbly top. Taste is
  richly toffee caramel malts but with a wonderful sustained bitterness in a long
  finish. Little carbonation and an oily texture. This was labeled &quot;vintage&quot;
  Chimpagne with 10.5% abv, and the ageing had done it good &#40;a bit like ourselves.&#41;"'
