| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma heavily malted. Pours amber with white bubbly top. Taste is richly toffee caramel malts but with a wonderful sustained bitterness in a long finish. Little carbonation and an oily texture. This was labeled &quot;vintage&quot; Chimpagne with 10.5% abv, and the ageing had done it good &#40;a bit like ourselves.&#41; |
