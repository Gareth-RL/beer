| **Comments** | Bottle at The Overdraught. Pours very dark almost black with thin tan lace halo. Aroma has coffee caramelized malts dark chocolate gateau and background fruit notes. Taste is medium to full sweet to eradicate the burn. And this ensures that the medium+ body has a smooth feel soft carbonation and a luxuriant long and largely sweet finish but by no means cloying. These are the beers for great occasions the beers that can convert those who say they don't like beer. By accident rather than design I had two modest cask ales before this and for me it's as big a jump as from supermarket wine to the finest brandy. |
