Brewer: Pentrich Brewing Co.
City: Pentrich
Comments: Can. Poured an unclear dark chestnut body with fading lacing. Aroma has
  some hedgerow fruits and some spice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some caramel
  in the background that loiters in the finish alongside the spicy hops to create
  a slight odd aftertaste. Palate is medium bodied, smooth enough, average to fizzy
  carbonation, and this odd licorice finish for a bitter. Not sure why the tradition
  should be categorized as vicious.
