Beer: Tring Moloko
BeerID: 359946
Brewer: Tring Brewery
City: Tring
Comments: Cask. Very dark almost black. One malty on the nose but overall the aroma
  is unremarkable. I say this because the taste itself is very good with a smooth
  sweet caramel paired with chocolate orange undertones. Moderately full-bodied with
  a pleasantly creamy residue. A find.
