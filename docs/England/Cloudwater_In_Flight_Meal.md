Comments: '"Can at home acquired from The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours rich amber
  with scummy lace top. Full aroma of citrus fruits and honeyed malts. Taste is medium
  sweet with long caramel note and a spicy finish; it reminded me of barley sugars
  at one point. Palate is medium bodied but with a sticky texture, soft carbonation
  and a long malt dominated finish. For those among us who like the malt flavours
  this imperial is a good example of how it can be done while still allowing room
  for the citrus fruits. Obviously the 10% carries its own allowance which both boosts
  the pleasure of the beer and diminishes the quantity and frequency with which I
  will drink it! Personally given the frequency with which I fly Ryanair these days,
  I am reassured that this is not their In Flight Meal as the folks aboard can get
  happy on an accumulator rather than a single load. It would be good to hear that
  the South Korean beer industry has surged ahead as a result of Tae Han Lee''s return.
  Cloudwater should keep us updated given Brewdog''s Indian plans."'
