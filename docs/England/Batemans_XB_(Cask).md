Beer: Batemans XB (Cask)
BeerID: 4675
Brewer: Batemans
City: Wainfleet
Comments: Cask. Aroma, malty yeast. Pours copper, white top. Strong lace. The taste
  is balanced as promised with some hoppy fruits and toasted malts with a sour final
  tang. I’m surprised it’s taken me so long to rate it. A dependable old brew that
  may disappoint some.
