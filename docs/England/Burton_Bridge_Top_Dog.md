| **Comments** | A pleasant surprise as I’m more a porter than a stout man. Aroma more black coffee than chocolate for me. Thin head with lace. Dark through and through. Smooth tasting with hop finish. Almost sorry &#40;almost&#41; it’s 5% as it could monopolize my attention for an evening. And that is not usual in a stout. Admittedly the other 8 ales on offer tend towards the extra pale. |
