| **Comments** | Tap at The Neon Raptor taproom Nottingham. It was popular with locals who had it by the pint. Aroma has a definite dairy note that for me eclipsed the fruit although some cranberries survived. Pours a red wine scarlet with bubbles more than lace atop. Taste is medium sour but with what is reminiscent of cheese along the way. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. I wanted this to be better than it was as NB look like brewers who will do great ale. But judging by other Berliner this is a work in progress  |
