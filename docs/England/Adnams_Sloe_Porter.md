Brewer: Adnams
City: Southwold
Comments: Cask. Maybe I got a duff batch. Aroma was nondescript with only a hint of
  fruit at the back. Pours dark with thin tan top. The sloes are there in the taste,
  giving a muted plummy quality and a slight squeeze on the palate. I may need to
  re-rate at some point as this one may be anomalous.
