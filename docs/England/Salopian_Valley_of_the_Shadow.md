| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of rich coffee malts.background nuts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a lot to savour chocolate and more coffee and some pine hops in the back as well. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Rich and complex and well worth a second visit                                                                                       |
