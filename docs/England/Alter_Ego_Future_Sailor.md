Comments: '"Poured dark brown body tan cream lace top. Aroma of dark malts: chocolate,
  coffee, with rum & raisins as well. Medium sweet to lightly bitter: rum raisin and
  a hint of milky chocolate. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and
  a bitter finish. I almost put this in the milk stout category given the extravagances
  that pastry stouts now entail, but it is sweet and infused with rum & raisin so
  that pushes it over the edge. Decent enough."'
