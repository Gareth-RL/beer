| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan cream lace top. Aroma of dark malts: chocolate, coffee, with rum & raisins as well. Medium sweet to lightly bitter: rum raisin and a hint of milky chocolate. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. I almost put this in the milk stout category given the extravagances that pastry stouts now entail, but it is sweet and infused with rum & raisin so that pushes it over the edge. Decent enough. |
