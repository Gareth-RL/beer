| **Comments** | Cask at The Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours dark brown with off white lace. Aroma has roasted malts and berry fruits. Taste is medium bitter wrapped in modest one could say mild sweetness. Palate is medium bodied at most, given that it is named after the inventor of Sellotape, I was hoping for a definite sticky texture, carbonation average, finish fruity. Good enough but never anything more. |
