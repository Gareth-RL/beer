| **Comments** | Pours very dank hazy cloudy orange body with scummy yeasty lace top. Fruity scent pineapple grapefruit papaya noted. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more citrus on the tongue, grapefruit satsuma etc. Light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft carbonation, and they seem to have escaped the chalky finish for the most part. I keep telling myself that I should try more Black Iris since when they are good they are exceptional. But even in Nottingham, they have a core repertoire and the new stuff goes to can quickly. |
