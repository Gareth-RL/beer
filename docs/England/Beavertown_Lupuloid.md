| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma has bread malts and floral citrus hops with the hops obviously dominant as spicy fruit notes fill the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter accordingly. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to soft carbonation, although there is a background fizz, and the finish is modestly bitter but soft rather than crisp. I remain a Beavertown novice but this seems typical. |
