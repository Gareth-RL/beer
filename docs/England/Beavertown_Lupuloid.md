Beer: Beavertown Lupuloid
BeerID: 446727
Brewer: Beavertown Brewery (Heineken)
City: Tottenham Hale
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma has bread malts and floral citrus hops with the
  hops obviously dominant as spicy fruit notes fill the mouth. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly bitter accordingly. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to soft
  carbonation, although there is a background fizz, and the finish is modestly bitter
  but soft rather than crisp. I remain a Beavertown novice but this seems typical.
