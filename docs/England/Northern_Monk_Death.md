| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours murky dark brackish black with tan top. Aroma has chocolate plum and berry fruits atop a resonant dark malts intensity. Taste is medium sweet, obviously alcoholic warmth, and a chocolate note or three. Palate is rich, creamy full bodied although the carbonation is above soft, and the finish is languorous and luxurious. Well done that monk... 31 Aug I went and bought another and on this occasion the aroma was more muted 7, the look was the same 4. The taste had the alcohol but less chocolate 6 and the palate was less creamy and more carbonation 3. So overall less wow factor than before and more expensive. I hope you have my first experience.  |
