Comments: '"Poured dark brown body tan lace top.  Aroma of chocolate and caramel malts.
  Medium sweet to bitter with toffee alongside coffee and chocolate notes. Medium
  to light bodied raggedy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I like
  the underlying porter recipe at NR so just hope the variants don''t obliterate it.  This
  one is flawed for feel.  "'
