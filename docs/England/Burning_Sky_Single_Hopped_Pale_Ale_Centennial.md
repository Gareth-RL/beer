Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy golden yellow with white foam
  top. Aroma has caramel malt below hop fruits. Taste is medium grainy sweet to bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied, smooth feel, average carbonation and a finish that hints
  at the abv in a gentle way &#40;a prod rather than a kick&#41;. Overall a solid
  IPA that plays its Centennial string well "'
