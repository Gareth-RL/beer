| **Comments** | Aroma is lemon and mango frankly, with grass and pine in secondary roles. Pours hazy pale yellow with a little lacing. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a light long vaguely sour finish. It descends into murk from a great height. |
