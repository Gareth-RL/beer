Comments: '"Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Pours a nice brown
  amber with diminishing lacing. There is an aroma of berry hop fruits and nicely
  roasted pale malt. The taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and the palate is
  medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation with a bitter finish. I am going
  to try to be a bit more generous in my grading of bitters since it&#39;s a British
  form that is hard to do exceptionally well and this is a very good example. I can
  easily imagine a pleasant evening spent with this."'
