Comments: '"Aroma has mango and grapefruit. Pours murky gold with white lace top.
  Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour and it''s a smooth transition. Palate is remarkably
  soft for an IPA so the yeasts worked - medium bodied oily texture soft carbonation
  and a smooth sour finish. What they need is an American partner to go global."'
