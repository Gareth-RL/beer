| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has cereal roasted malts and once you look for it elderflower and citrus hops. Pours rich golden brown with white lace. Taste is medium to full sweet to sour. Fullness comes from the thick texture but it is really medium bodied with average carbonation and a sticky finish. Like its namesake this is to be treated cautiously. |
