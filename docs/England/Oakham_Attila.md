Beer: Oakham Attila
BeerID: 26726
Brewer: Oakham Ales
City: Peterborough
Comments: Cask. Aroma has cereal roasted malts and once you look for it elderflower
  and citrus hops. Pours rich golden brown with white lace. Taste is medium to full
  sweet to sour. Fullness comes from the thick texture but it is really medium bodied
  with average carbonation and a sticky finish. Like its namesake this is to be treated
  cautiously.
