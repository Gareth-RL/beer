| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught. Pours dark brown body with thin tan lace thinning to a halo. Aroma is richly malted - coffee toffee chocolate licorice dark fruit and more cake than biscuit. Taste is medium sweet with some rough alcoholic back notes. Palate is medium bodied, smooth creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a licorice twist finish. As for the tropicality, maybe it&#39;s the Ekuanot hops. I would expect Jamaican rum myself. |
