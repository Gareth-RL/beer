Beer: Northern Monk Patrons Society Exclusive 003 - Project Pinda
BeerID: 796324
Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.
City: Leeds
Comments: A beer that delivers its potential. Aroma has caramel chocolate and peanut
  butter although the last is more evident in the taste. Poured black bodied with
  tan cream lace. Predictably full sweetness peanut note stretches this so that the
  dark chocolate bitterness is squeezed to the rim of the finish. Palate is medium
  to full bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long largely sweet
  finish which masks the alcohol somewhat so that the afterburn is light. A Project
  Pinta beer where perhaps less than a pint is enough.
