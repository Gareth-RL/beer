Beer: Nottingham Noel
BeerID: 82095
Brewer: Nottingham Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma is citrus hop. A pale gold body and white top. Taste is crisp
  initially with a clean fruit splash upon the palate and a residual bitterness not
  really that spicy for me. In turkey terms this is bland white meat. Like so much
  of life these days, it needs stuffing.
