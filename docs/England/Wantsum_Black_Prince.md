Beer: Wantsum Black Prince
BeerID: 187888
Brewer: Wantsum Brewery
City: St Nicholas At Wade
Comments: Cask. Aroma is roasted malts. Pours dark brown with tan top that yields
  broken lacing. Taste is nicely complex with roasted malt coffee and bread notes.
  It shows what a 3.9% beer can give and why mild is a style worth keeping.
