| **Comments** | Poured rich red chestnut body with thin tan lace top. Aroma has hints of vanilla and red currant. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the currants making their presence known alongside some cocoa. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not as richly chocolate as brownie suggests nor as vanilla rich as the aroma implied. But pleasant enough One point out of three ain't bad. |
