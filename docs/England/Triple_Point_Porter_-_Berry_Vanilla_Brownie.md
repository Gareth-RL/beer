Comments: '"Poured rich red chestnut body with thin tan lace top. Aroma has hints
  of vanilla and red currant. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the currants making
  their presence known alongside some cocoa. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not as richly chocolate as brownie suggests
  nor as vanilla rich as the aroma implied. But pleasant enough One point out of three
  ain''t bad."'
