Beer: Wylam Barrel Aged Wee Heavy
BeerID: 550018
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Keg at The Keans Head Nottingham. Pours murky brown with fleeting thin halo.
  Aroma is boozy, more than the Imperial that preceded this folly. But it has dark
  fruit and spice and oak vanilla. Taste is medium to full sweet but with alcoholic
  heat. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to flat carbonation and a sweet
  lingering finish. If you like fruitcake desserts this will please but it could do
  with less booze.
