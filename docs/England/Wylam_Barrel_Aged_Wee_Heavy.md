| **Comments** | Keg at The Keans Head Nottingham. Pours murky brown with fleeting thin halo. Aroma is boozy, more than the Imperial that preceded this folly. But it has dark fruit and spice and oak vanilla. Taste is medium to full sweet but with alcoholic heat. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to flat carbonation and a sweet lingering finish. If you like fruitcake desserts this will please but it could do with less booze. |
