| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma lightly malted hops fruits with marmalade smear. Pours orange dark amber with off white lace top. Taste is medium bitter with sour finish. Any sweet is forward and fleeting. Carbonation light and this may explain the indeterminate finish. Basically it dies. Not precisely the accolade associated with a 3000th brew but I have memories of bygone days when a large number if not 3000 of these would have kept the chatter going. |
