Comments: '"Poured yellow body white foam top. Aroma muted fruit pale malts. Medium
  sweet to sour. Balanced in the sense of bland. Medium bodied smooth texture average
  carbonation and a sour finish. 04/12/24 second sipping on cask at the Sir Joihn
  2 years on. Not a lot to add to the review of the bottle version.  Another beer
  that''s festive only on the pump clip. "'
