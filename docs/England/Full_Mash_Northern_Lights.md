Comments: 'Cask. Pours dark with tan cream top and has a pleasant malt aroma. But
  it’s a disappointment. Too thin and watery for a stout. Just the faintest smoked
  tang on the palate. 31/10/17 a better sample. More malty licorice on the nose, slightly
  fuller on the palate.  But still a thin stout. 31/10/21 it seems to be my choice
  for Halloween. Scores the same. This time outside in a windy tent '
