| **Comments** | Tap and it took the barmaid 3 attempts to pull a half. I note that it got rave reviews in 2010 and north of here. Time and distance has diminished its appeal so it doesn’t teleport well. Some of the 10 malts are roasted judging by the scent. Taste has coffee. Dark chocolate and maybe some plum. A beer of this type should have more staying power on the palate. Indeed, more heft overall. Not the best £3.20 investment of the week&#033; |
