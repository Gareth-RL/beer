Beer: Arbor Yakima Valley American IPA
BeerID: 138945
Brewer: Arbor Ales
City: Bristol
Comments: Aroma of grassy hops and lightly malty. Pours murky orange body with thin
  lace. Taste is medium sweet with more malt than expected given the emphasis on hops
  in the description. The hops deliver some mango citrus notes but it remains toffee
  coated. Fortunately I like the effect. Palate is medium but dank with a definite
  cling, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly one of the fuller
  APAs I have tried.
