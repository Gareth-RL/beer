| **Comments** | A relatively muted aroma of dark malts and coffee grounds. Pours dark body tan cream top and ruby lights. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter but fruity finish. Given the strength, understated. But pleasant enough. |
