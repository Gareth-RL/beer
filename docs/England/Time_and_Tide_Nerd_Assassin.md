| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white foam top. Aroma has hay, citrus, and more pith than juice. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sweet. Palate is medium bodied, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Like many a New England IPA, I don&#39;t really get what they were aiming for, but given the name, I may be yet to feel the wound. |
