| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours orange golden with white lace top. Aroma is muted but a little hop fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation, and a soft finish. A session beer of nondescript merit and defects. |
