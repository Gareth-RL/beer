Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma of dark malt but with some fruit that is not hop derived. Pours dark
  brown with tan cream top. Taste is medium sweet and the berries are red. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky texture average to soft carbonation. Not sure what they
  were aiming for, but fruit porters are tricky to get right. Maybe I am too retro
