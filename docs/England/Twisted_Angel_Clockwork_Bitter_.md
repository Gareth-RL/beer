| **Comments** | Cask at Beerheadz Nottingham. Aroma has cereal, nuts, on the malt side and floral herbal hop. Pours a rich amber brown with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet from the roasted malts and bitter from the hop. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. I suspect my palate is changing - it&#39;s been a while since I had a bitter that excited it. So don&#39;t let my waning faculties deter you. |
