| **Comments** | Cask at the Falcon. Best bitter. Pleasant fruit aroma. Pours copper with amber lights and thin top. A light bitter with good balance of fruit and bready notes in the taste. A largely clean finish in the palate in terms of sweetness but some hops in the mix. A safe bet. Very good rather than best. |
