Brewer: Dukeries Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: Cask at the Falcon. Best bitter. Pleasant fruit aroma. Pours copper with
  amber lights and thin top. A light bitter with good balance of fruit and bready
  notes in the taste. A largely clean finish in the palate in terms of sweetness but
  some hops in the mix. A safe bet. Very good rather than best.
