Beer: Bowland Boxer Blonde
BeerID: 604609
Brewer: Bowland Brewery
City: Clitheroe
Comments: A bit of lemony hop but not a strong nose. Pours straw pale with white lace.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a stronger fruit quotient and yep a hint of
  gooseberry. Palate is thin to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and
  a light bitter finish. Easy drinking.
