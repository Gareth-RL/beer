Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange gold with thin halo of off white
  bubbles. Aroma is banana loaf since there&#39;s toffee there as well. Taste is heavy
  cloying sweetness, that fades to medium sweet but allows for little else. But I
  guess you are warned and I have drunk worse. "'
