| **Comments** | Collaboration with Good Chemistry Brewing as a Belgian Dubbel. Aroma of dark fruits and malts. Pours rich chestnut with tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a definite date or raisins note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a fruity finish. It grows on you   |
