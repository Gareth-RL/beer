| **Comments** | Poured murky orange body with foamy white lace top. Plenty of pine in the nose with citrus evident too. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Juicy initially grapefruit and a hint of melon and mango, then more resin and pale malt notes culminating in a drying finish. Palate is medium bodied, average to high carbonation but that is there to postpone the mouth-drying I suspect. I can imagine this beer tasting great in a summer beer garden so a can in dark December with rain and sleet outside is not optimal. In terms of fusing West Coast resinous crispness with East Coast juiciness, the West wins. Still it slips down easy.  |
