Comments: '"Pours black with thin lace. Aroma of milky chocolate and coffee malt.
  Taste is medium sweet with not a lot else, maybe you move from milk chocolate to
  sponge.Texture is medium to full body, sticky feel soft carbonation and a light
  fruit finish. Drink your cake. 08/11/23 still chocolate cake dominant. It''s a beer
  to end rather than begin the evening."'
