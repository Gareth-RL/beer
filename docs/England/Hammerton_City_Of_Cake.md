| **Comments** | Pours black with thin lace. Aroma of milky chocolate and coffee malt. Taste is medium sweet with not a lot else, maybe you move from milk chocolate to sponge.Texture is medium to full body, sticky feel soft carbonation and a light fruit finish. Drink your cake. 08/11/23 still chocolate cake dominant. It's a beer to end rather than begin the evening. |
