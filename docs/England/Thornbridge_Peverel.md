| **Comments** | Pours very pale with Lace top. Aroma is predictably hoppy but not the explosive tropical scent that the marketing guy experienced. More cocaine needed. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium to thin bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a slightly souring finish. Overall good from a brewery that does great. |
