| **Comments** | Aroma has hedgerow hops and pale malt. Pours clear golden with lasting white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Definitely a biscuit bitter note that makes me think the rebranding of Black Sheep is more pumpclip than beer. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. A session ale and there's not wrong with that as long as you want a session. |
