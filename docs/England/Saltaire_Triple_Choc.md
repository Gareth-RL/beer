| **Comments** | Cask. Pours mahogany dark with tan cream top. Aroma decidedly chocolate and more Cadburys than Lindt. Taste sweet chocolate malt with mild coffee notes and fruity tang. The best stout on the Nottingham stroll this year and in Wetherspoons. 06/03/2018 Still a very flavour full stout and this time sampled at the Castle Rock tap house The Vat and Fiddle. |
