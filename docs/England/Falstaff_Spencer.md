| **Comments** | Cask at the Hand & Heart. Pours pale gold body with white lace top. Aroma has muted bramble hops and roasted malt. Taste is richer than scent. Medium sweet to bitter with definite berry notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a muted sweet and bitter finish which the purist may mistrust. However, in my view a really good new bitter and these are rare. |
