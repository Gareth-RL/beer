Comments: '"Labelled a traditional South German fest bier. Pours amber body copper
  tints. White lace top. Aroma has nuts, resin, woody, notes. Taste is lightly sweet
  to medium bitter with a twiglet finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a long finish. It tasted like an ESB to me, but then I don&#39;t
  drink in South Germany."'
