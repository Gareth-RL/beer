| **Comments** | Labelled a traditional South German fest bier. Pours amber body copper tints. White lace top. Aroma has nuts, resin, woody, notes. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a twiglet finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a long finish. It tasted like an ESB to me, but then I don&#39;t drink in South Germany. |
