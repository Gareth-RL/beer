| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is richly malt but with enough hop fruit to signal the pale direction of the taste. Pours reddish copper with off white top. Taste has molasses malt notes and berry hop fruits. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and an interestingly sour finish. A successful variant of the Grey. |
