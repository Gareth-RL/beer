| **Comments** | Aroma of milk chocolate and vanilla latte. Pours dark brown almost black bodied with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet but there's a backnote of lactic toothpaste bewilderment. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. Still decent despite the taste confusions. |
