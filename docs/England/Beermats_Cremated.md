Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company

Comments: Poured chestnut body off white lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and berry
  hops with a little smoke. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more hedgerow fruits
  and roasted malts. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish with a languor of smoke. A good deal more interesting than most ESBs.
