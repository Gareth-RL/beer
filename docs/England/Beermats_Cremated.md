| **Comments** | Poured chestnut body off white lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops with a little smoke. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more hedgerow fruits and roasted malts. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a light bitter finish with a languor of smoke. A good deal more interesting than most ESBs. |
