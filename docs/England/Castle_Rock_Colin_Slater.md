Beer: Castle Rock Colin Slater
BeerID: 390439
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma of roasted malt, licorice and dark fruits. Pours black with
  tan top. Some lacing. Tastes of damson and date on biscuity base. Medium bodied
  with a slightly salty savour on the palate. Named for a local sports reporter. And
  a bargain since the Brewery is 39 years of today. £1 off all ales at the tap house.
  A saving for one night only so sorry to gloat.
