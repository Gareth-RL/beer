Comments: A really nice porter with coffee and chocolate malt in the aroma. Poured
  dark mahogany body with scummy lace top. Taste is sweet chocolate and bitter coffee
  with a smooth transition and good bitter finish. In fact I just convinced myself
  to raise it a point for taste. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Far above some other cask porters but I
  have been spoiled by craft flavour and a longstanding bias towards fruit porters
  over coffee.
