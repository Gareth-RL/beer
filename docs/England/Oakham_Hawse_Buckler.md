| **Comments** | At the Rail Ale festival. A fitting finish with a very divisive brew. Pours dark body and tan lacing. Aroma unusually for a stout has piny hops coming through the roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter but complex. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture,average carbonation.and a bitter finish. Solid stout for me but not earth shattering. |
