Beer: Oakham Hawse Buckler
BeerID: 65058
Brewer: Oakham Ales
City: Peterborough
Comments: At the Rail Ale festival. A fitting finish with a very divisive brew. Pours
  dark body and tan lacing. Aroma unusually for a stout has piny hops coming through
  the roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter but complex. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture,average carbonation.and a bitter finish. Solid stout for me but not
  earth shattering.
