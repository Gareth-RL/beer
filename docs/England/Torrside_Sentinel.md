| **Comments** | Poured dark reddish chestnut body with tan foam lacing. Pungent aroma of bread malts and bitter fruity hops. Taste is lightly sweet, medium bitter with a souring tang. Fairly described as a hoppy porter as the hop bitterness wins out over the roasted malts. Palate is medium bodied, carbonation is average, smooth texture but a definite dry hop finish. A good thirst quenching porter from a brewery I hope to drink more of. |
