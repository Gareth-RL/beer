| **Comments** | Bottle from the Overdraught. Pours black coffee with just a bubble of lace halo. Aroma is pungently roasted coffee malts and vanilla with caramel notes. Taste is medium to full sweet with light bitter back note and a modicum of heat in the finish. Palate is medium to full bodied silky vanilla creamy texture soft carbonation and a little alcohol evident in the finish. Overall it takes its forebear forward and is perilously easy given its potency. Get it for Xmas. |
