| **Comments** | Aroma of roasted malts and berry fruit. Pours dark chestnut with tan/off-white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lasting bitter with hop tang. Palate is medium bodied at most, watery feel, average to soft carbonation bitter finish. A dry stout possibly, a bitter porter certainly. Well named and the pump clip with Tony Hancock captures an aspect of the stout and porter drinker too well. |
