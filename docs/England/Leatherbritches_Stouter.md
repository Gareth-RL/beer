Beer: Leatherbritches Stouter
BeerID: 145450
Brewer: Leatherbritches Brewery
City: Ashby De La Zouch
Comments: Aroma of roasted malts and berry fruit. Pours dark chestnut with tan/off-white
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to lasting bitter with hop tang. Palate is medium bodied
  at most, watery feel, average to soft carbonation bitter finish. A dry stout possibly,
  a bitter porter certainly. Well named and the pump clip with Tony Hancock captures
  an aspect of the stout and porter drinker too well.
