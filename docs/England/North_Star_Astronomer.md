Comments: Cask. Mocha. There’s a definite chocolate coffee showdown in the scent.
  Pours a dark stout with tan top. The theme continues in the taste but with the addition
  of some hop fruits amidst the chocolate creme. Hence this is a more than reasonable
  stout. Smooth rich and filling. Only the Samuel Lamberts of the world could cope
  with several. But the most flavour found today.
