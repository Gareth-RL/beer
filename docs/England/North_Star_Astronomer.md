| **Comments** | Cask. Mocha. Thereâ€™s a definite chocolate coffee showdown in the scent. Pours a dark stout with tan top. The theme continues in the taste but with the addition of some hop fruits amidst the chocolate creme. Hence this is a more than reasonable stout. Smooth rich and filling. Only the Samuel Lamberts of the world could cope with several. But the most flavour found today. |
