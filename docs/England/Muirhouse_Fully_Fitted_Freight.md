Comments: Cask. Aroma malt and fruit stones. Pours golden white top broken lacing.
  Taste has more fruit peach and a hint of lemon. So ultimately a palatable bitter
  that will keep you on the rails no matter how fully freighted you may feel. 20/05/18
  no change but apologies for extending the train metaphor above. 24/01/20 clearly
  one of my locals (Room with a Brew) swops its Scribblers ale for Muirhouse. 3rd
  time here. Still fine without going beyond the rails of golden tbitter
