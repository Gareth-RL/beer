| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma malt and fruit stones. Pours golden white top broken lacing. Taste has more fruit peach and a hint of lemon. So ultimately a palatable bitter that will keep you on the rails no matter how fully freighted you may feel. 20/05/18 no change but apologies for extending the train metaphor above. 24/01/20 clearly one of my locals (Room with a Brew) swops its Scribblers ale for Muirhouse. 3rd time here. Still fine without going beyond the rails of golden tbitter |
