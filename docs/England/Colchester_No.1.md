| **Comments** | Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops. Copper body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A decent bitter but I prefer others in their range.<br>Earlier Rating: 5/29/2016 Total Score: 3<br>Cask. Definite scent of stewed tea and sour biscuit. Pours copper amber with lace top more smear than coating. Well balanced soft blended hop fruit and biscuit malt. Gentle carbonation and soft coating of the palate. A pretty good session bitter and they are less common than you think. |
