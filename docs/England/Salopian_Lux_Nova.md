| **Comments** | Pours pale gold with generous white foam top and lacing. Aroma is lightly citric, pine and spice notes, although I couldn&#39;t distinguish the coriander or clove. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a  light wheat sweet quality dominant. Palate is light to medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Maybe the lux in the title is a pun... Light and refreshing  |
