| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan cream top diminishing to thin lace. Aroma of roasted malts with tobacco and coffee grounds noted. Medium sweet to bitter with more malt loaf and raisins. Medium sweet to bitter quite a brisk transition for a traditional porter. Medium to light body smooth texture average carbonation and a long finish. A worthy entry to the porter class. |
