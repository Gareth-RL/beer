| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours light gold body with white lace top. There is a citrus musk that could be lemon or lime but it&#39;s been left too long in a basement &#40;hints of mould on a lemon skin. Taste is modest but with a similar stale quality. I&#39;m wondering about the keg. Palate is medium bodied but with a dusty rather than sticky feel and a bitter finish. I was left thinking more of hospitals than holidays and I left most of it. These are the risks of beer tasting. And it may just be a rogue serving. |
