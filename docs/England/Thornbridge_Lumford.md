| **Comments** | Cask. Pleasant aroma of grapefruit and gooseberry. Pours golden with thin cream top. Tastes predictably citric with hints of grassy hops as well. A summer ale in my view with no great fullness. It leaves the palate embittered rather than washed. I guess thatâ€™s one way to prompt the next mouthful. It will move me to another beer. Too dry for my taste. |
