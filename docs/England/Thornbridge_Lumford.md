Comments: Cask. Pleasant aroma of grapefruit and gooseberry. Pours golden with thin
  cream top. Tastes predictably citric with hints of grassy hops as well. A summer
  ale in my view with no great fullness. It leaves the palate embittered rather than
  washed. I guess that’s one way to prompt the next mouthful. It will move me to another
  beer. Too dry for my taste.
