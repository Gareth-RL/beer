Brewer: Duration Brewing
City: West Acre
Comments: Aroma has a  stack of malt coffee chocolate and licorice. Pours black brown
  with tan thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with pleasant chocolate notes.
  Palate is medium bodied, oily to sticky texture, soft to average carbonation and
  bitter finish but with a little ash. So lots going on in a good way and how often
  can one put those clichés in the same sentence?
