| **Comments** | Aroma has a  stack of malt coffee chocolate and licorice. Pours black brown with tan thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with pleasant chocolate notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily to sticky texture, soft to average carbonation and bitter finish but with a little ash. So lots going on in a good way and how often can one put those clich√©s in the same sentence? |
