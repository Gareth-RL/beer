Beer: Track Chabudai
BeerID: 609691
Brewer: Track Brewing Co.
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Aroma is emphatically lemon lime citrus.
  Pours hazy cloudy yellow with white lace top. Taste is medium sour and bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, and a long finish.
  A decidedly odd IPA by my lights. And offered here as table beer which accords with
  its positive reception in Belgium. Here it may find less favour.
