| **Comments** | Keg at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with thin lace halo. Aroma has a lot of tropical buzz but the flaked oats lurk as well. Mostly in the texture to be fair. Taste is juicy, medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied with a sticky to creamy oat texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Very nice  |
