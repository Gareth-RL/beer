| **Comments** | Drawn from the barrel at the Sir John as one of their festival specials. A seasonal ale that pour reddish brown with very little head if any. Vanilla and almond overpower cherry in the scent. But they are there in the taste which is very sweet initially with thankfully a bitter background. A watery palate. Personally this is the runt of the litter that spawned the vanilla stout. I simply cannot imagine an evening drinking this. But that is what seasonal special beer is for. To stretch rather than affirm the taste buds. |
