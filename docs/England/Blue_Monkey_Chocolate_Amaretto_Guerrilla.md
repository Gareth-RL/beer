Comments: '"Cask. Pours black with a foam tan top. Strong lacing. Aroma pungently
  amaretto with chocolate in the background. Predictably sweet and creamy taste and
  the purists might be reminded of the syrups they offer for flavoured coffee. But
  this is more gorilla than guerrilla - a gentle beast, largely harmless and wonderful.
  And worth a second visit. 13/03/2024 five years later and it''s still good 25/05/24
  obviously liked it "'
