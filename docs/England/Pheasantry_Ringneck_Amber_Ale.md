| **Comments** | No one has reviewed it since 2017! I can only assume it has returned to active status recently.  Poured copper brown body white lace top.  Aroma of berry hops and roasted malts.  Medium sweet to bitter some light fruit and caramel malts.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Not bad for a bitter so why the hiatus? |
