City: Newark
Comments: No one has reviewed it since 2017! I can only assume it has returned to
  active status recently.  Poured copper brown body white lace top.  Aroma of berry
  hops and roasted malts.  Medium sweet to bitter some light fruit and caramel malts.  Medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Not bad for a bitter
  so why the hiatus?
