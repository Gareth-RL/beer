Beer: Little Critters Sleepy Badger
BeerID: 407682
Brewer: Little Critters Brewing Co.
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask. Aroma of toasted malts with coffee notes. Pours dark with tan top
  and decent lacing. Medium textured with some dark fruits and hoppy bitterness in
  the taste. But the languor on the palate is not creamy enough to win higher grade.
  The phrase, I believe, is &quot;good but no cigar.&quot;
