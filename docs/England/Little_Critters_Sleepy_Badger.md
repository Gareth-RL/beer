| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of toasted malts with coffee notes. Pours dark with tan top and decent lacing. Medium textured with some dark fruits and hoppy bitterness in the taste. But the languor on the palate is not creamy enough to win higher grade. The phrase, I believe, is &quot;good but no cigar.&quot; |
