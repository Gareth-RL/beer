Comments: 'Cask. Pours dark brown white to tan top. Aroma malty with some licorice
  notes. Taste sweet merging to bitter with a watery finish. Unremarkable 4/02/20
  second sipping at Beerheadz which is usually a source of interesting good ale (so
  surprised to see it). To be fair both the taste and texture were better than last
  time. 8/02/23 I sip it at infrequent intervals. Still okay but not great '
