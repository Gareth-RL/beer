Brewer: Grafton Brewing
City: Worksop
Comments: Cask. Pours golden the lace top. Soft fruity scent. Yeasty. I can’t lie.
  The taste is underwhelming. In a beer culture awash with pales and hoppy ales, I
  have been making an effort to be broad-minded. At least until the mild trail starts
  but a pale like this confirms all my prejudices. If this is Lancelot Arthur can
  give Guinevere free rein.
