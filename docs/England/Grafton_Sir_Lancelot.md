| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden the lace top. Soft fruity scent. Yeasty. I canâ€™t lie. The taste is underwhelming. In a beer culture awash with pales and hoppy ales, I have been making an effort to be broad-minded. At least until the mild trail starts but a pale like this confirms all my prejudices. If this is Lancelot Arthur can give Guinevere free rein. |
