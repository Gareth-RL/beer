Brewer: Scribblers Ales
City: Nottingham
Comments: Sweet fruit aroma. Poured golden with thin lace top; not the most amber
  of amber lagers. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a slight buttery quality.
  Palate is medium bodied, smooth, average to fizzy carbonation, and slightly clammy
  finish. This is not a crisp lager. It is also another case of my reading what others
  have labelled the beer, The brewer sees it as a hybrid of APA and lager and the
  rival sites label it amber lager. I suspect it is not a great APA. I bought it because
  there are many Scribblers beer I do like and I want to keep them producing through
  the present crisis. But this is well below the level of their core range of pales.
