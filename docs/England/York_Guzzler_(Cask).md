Comments: 'Poured golden light amber body with thin lace top. Aroma of light caramel
  malts and similar berry hops. Taste is medium sweet fruity but with a more astringent
  bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, soapy feel, bitter finish. Not keen on the
  mouth feel - it would detract from a session. Second sipping 4/03/22 not as bitter
  but still not keen on the texture or finish '
