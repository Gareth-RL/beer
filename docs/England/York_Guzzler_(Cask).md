| **Comments** | Poured golden light amber body with thin lace top. Aroma of light caramel malts and similar berry hops. Taste is medium sweet fruity but with a more astringent bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, soapy feel, bitter finish. Not keen on the mouth feel - it would detract from a session. Second sipping 4/03/22 not as bitter but still not keen on the texture or finish  |
