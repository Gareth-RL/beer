| **Comments** | Tap @Brewdog Nottingham. Pours murky brown with thin vaporous lace. Aroma has chocolate cake and red berries. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter. Palate is frankly thin for a stout and the texture is sticky rather than silky carbonation soft and finish bitter. If this were a gateau it would spoil in my company as a small slice would be enough. |
