Comments: '"Tap @Brewdog Nottingham. Pours murky brown with thin vaporous lace. Aroma
  has chocolate cake and red berries. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter. Palate
  is frankly thin for a stout and the texture is sticky rather than silky carbonation
  soft and finish bitter. If this were a gateau it would spoil in my company as a
  small slice would be enough."'
