Beer: Holdens Toffee Porter
BeerID: 484319
Brewer: Holdens Brewery
City: Dudley
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with ruby lights and a tan top. Good lacing. Aroma unsurprisingly
  toffee malts. And the taste is much the same with some dark chocolate notes as well
  and that was fine by me. A short bitter finish so only a richer creamy texture was
  lacking for perfection.
