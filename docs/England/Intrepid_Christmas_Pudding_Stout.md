Beer: Intrepid Christmas Pudding Stout
BeerID: 481851
Brewer: Intrepid Brewing Co.
City: Bradwell
Comments: Tap. Aroma Is a challenge of complexity - treacle, dark fruit, basement,
  yeast, licorice, rebrewed coffee with maybe an oyster thrown in. Pours black with
  tan bubbly top. The taste has the fruity portions of the eponymous pudding very
  much in evidence and understandably licorice notes creep in the aftertaste but the
  bitterness on the palate is consistently beaten back by dried fruit. No threepenny
  piece though.
