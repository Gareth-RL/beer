Comments: '"Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours golden with thin top. Aroma pineapples
  and tangerines. Taste also has fruits to the foreground and an edgy spicy at the
  end. Light to medium body with a clean finish rather than any residue. This was
  Blue Monkey’s breakthrough beer so I’m amazed that I haven’t rated it before. It
  goes down well with the student clientele around here &#40;those who cant afford
  Vedett Blonde at £4.90 a pint. A safe bet to quench the thirst "'
