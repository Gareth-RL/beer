BeerID: 297103
Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Smells like cappuccino but looks like an Americano with crema to spare.
  Certainly the malts have a burned sugar toffee caramel quality but thankfully enough
  bitterness lurks in the background to prevent this beer turning into a dessert.
  A nice novelty but unlikely to be a daily choice. Still Tuck Italiano was worth
  a punt. 12/13/23 Eight years later so certainly not a daily tipple. Emphatically
  butterscotch
