| **Comments** | Smells like cappuccino but looks like an Americano with crema to spare. Certainly the malts have a burned sugar toffee caramel quality but thankfully enough bitterness lurks in the background to prevent this beer turning into a dessert. A nice novelty but unlikely to be a daily choice. Still Tuck Italiano was worth a punt. 12/13/23 Eight years later so certainly not a daily tipple. Emphatically butterscotch |
