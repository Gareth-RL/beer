| **Comments** | Piney resinous cereal grains nose. Pours reddish orange brown with thin scummy lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some toffee malt and spicy hop evident. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a long sourcing finish.  I am not a big fan of reds so this has done well. |
