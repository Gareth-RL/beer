Beer: The Kernel London Brick Centennial
BeerID: 474083
Brewer: The Kernel Brewery
City: Bermondsey
Comments: Piney resinous cereal grains nose. Pours reddish orange brown with thin
  scummy lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some toffee malt and spicy
  hop evident. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and
  a long sourcing finish.  I am not a big fan of reds so this has done well.
