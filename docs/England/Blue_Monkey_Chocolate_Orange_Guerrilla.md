| **Comments** | As some may know, gorillas need protection. And the splendid Guerilla Stout needs guarding from flavouring that is brazen and emphatic. Chocolate yes. Amaretto maybe but orange! Get back in the trees. Leave it to Terrys.  And it does little for the palate either.. Still it's Guerilla. 03/12/24 second sipping.  5 years on and Xmas brings it back. Very orange. Protect your gorillas  |
