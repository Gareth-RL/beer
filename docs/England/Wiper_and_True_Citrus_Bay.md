| **Comments** | Listed as Citrus Bay 2. Keg. Aroma caramel malts and grapefruit and pineapples for the hops. Pours dark orange with thin lacing. Marmalade notes. Taste is medium to heavy sweet and richly so given the abv. It makes me wonder where in the scheme of things Imperial ales belong? A treat? End of the evening? Solo tasting? |
