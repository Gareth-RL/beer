Beer: '"Thornbridge AM:PM Gluten Free"'
BeerID: 1041564
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Bottle, picked up while strolling near Thornbridge Hall. The gluten free
  version has yet to find fans. Certainly sessionable, but the aroma is relatively
  muted with the pale malts holding their own against some modest fruit notes. Maybe
  a hint of pineapple. Taste is similarly balanced -sweet and bitter plod the medial
  line. Medium bodied with some mouth coating evident, average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. Another beer that might taste better in a summer beer garden than at a November
  kitchen table. Certainly not their finest.
