| **Comments** | Bottle, picked up while strolling near Thornbridge Hall. The gluten free version has yet to find fans. Certainly sessionable, but the aroma is relatively muted with the pale malts holding their own against some modest fruit notes. Maybe a hint of pineapple. Taste is similarly balanced -sweet and bitter plod the medial line. Medium bodied with some mouth coating evident, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Another beer that might taste better in a summer beer garden than at a November kitchen table. Certainly not their finest. |
