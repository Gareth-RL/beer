| **Comments** | Bottle. I am continuing my project of reintroducing myself to English bitter after 7 months of continental living where other beers predominate. This one presents well with a rich amber/golden body and a full foam lace top. More malt than hop on the nose with some grainy nutty notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with strong malt spine and a little grassy piney hop lurking in the finish. Texture is medium bodied, somewhat grainy, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. I can imagine an afternoon in a pub garden where this would be enough, but so far my return to Bitter is also reminding me how rare it is to find an example that truly impresses. It is a modest style--self-effacing, diffident--rather English really |
