| **Comments** | X+ale 1885. Modern mild apparently smells lightly of toffee malt and citrus hops.  Pours hazy golden with thin lace Halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium at most, oily texture soft to average carbonation and a light fruity finish. I don't think these hops are mild suited. |
