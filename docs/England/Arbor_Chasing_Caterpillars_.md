| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught. Pours hazy yellow with broken white lace halo. Aroma is citric, orange peel and pineapple but with pine and floral background notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter then souring. Palate interfered. It&#39;s a sticky beast although no more than medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a finish that feels like a death sudden but lasting at the same time. Any beer that enables me to wax lyrical, gets an extra point. |
