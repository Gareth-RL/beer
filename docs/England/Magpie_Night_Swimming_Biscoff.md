| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body with tan lace top. Aroma is coffee rum and raisins with vanilla cream. Taste is medium to full sweet with coffee and chocolate raisins. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a slightly acidic finish - it's one bum note. Otherwise very pleasant |
