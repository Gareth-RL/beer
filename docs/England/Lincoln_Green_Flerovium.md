| **Comments** | Well aroma is faintly citrus with the emphasis on faint. Appearance is pale honey yellow with thin top. Taste has some grapefruit and melon so it suits those who like a blonde beer on the sweet side. A smooth wash of the palate with little bite. A session ale. But there are better on offer notably in this pub. Marion or Sheriff for instance. Harsh but fair. |
