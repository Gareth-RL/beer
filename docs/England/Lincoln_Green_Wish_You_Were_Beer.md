| **Comments**  | Poured cloudy pale yellow body thin lace top. Aroma tropical fruit nose grapefruit. Medium sweet to bitter with more grapefruit and a hint of melon. Medium bodied slightly mineral chalky texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Key question would you have a session of it? I suspect not                                                                                      |
