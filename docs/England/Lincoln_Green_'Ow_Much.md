| **Comments** | Offered at Â£1.50 a pint. Floral grassy hop nose of the modest retiring variety. Golden body with off white lace.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with citric grapefruit peel qualities.  Palate is thin watery feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Once this was the best on offer. You get what you pay for. |
