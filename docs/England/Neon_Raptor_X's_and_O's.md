| **Comments** | Double dried hops. Ella, Enigma, Vic Secret, and Citra. So it's an international southern hemisphere style pale. Aroma confirms the hops tropical fruit qualities although pineapple and citrus predominate. Pours pale yellow gold like watery orange juice. Thin lacing. Taste is medium sweet with what I call the toothpaste effect in terms of transition to bitter/sour. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Vegan by the way. Abv suggests a session pale but taste disagrees. |
