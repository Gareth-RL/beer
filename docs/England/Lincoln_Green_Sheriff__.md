| **Comments** | A sunny July evening in Nottingham seems like the perfect excuse for a pint of Lincoln Green Sheriff. There’s certainly citrus aroma and more on the orange than grapefruit end of the spectrum. In looks it’s hazy syrup gold. The brewer speaks off it’s strong bitterness but this speaks more to the 5.5% abv than the fullness of flavour. But it quenches. With Tuck manning the dark flank and Hood at the bitter centre, it may be that the Sheriff has at last joined the Merry Men. |
