Beer: Geeves Smokey Joe
BeerID: 161736
Brewer: Geeves Brewery
City: Barnsley
Comments: Aroma has berry fruit and dark coffee malts. Pours dark brown body and thin
  CV tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Roasted malts predominant with coffee
  grounds and berries lurking. Maybe a hint of licorice in the finish. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Labelled classic stout,
  and for some it may be better than that.
