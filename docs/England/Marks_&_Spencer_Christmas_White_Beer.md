Comments: Bottle (I was enticed by the £1 price tag). Poured hazy golden with white
  foam top. Spicy nose and a little light banana. Taste is medium sweet with a hint
  of clove especially in the finish. Light to medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation and a spiced finish. I had no expectations and I was not disappointed
