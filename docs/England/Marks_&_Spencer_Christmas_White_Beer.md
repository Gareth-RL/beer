| **Comments** | Bottle (I was enticed by the Â£1 price tag). Poured hazy golden with white foam top. Spicy nose and a little light banana. Taste is medium sweet with a hint of clove especially in the finish. Light to medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a spiced finish. I had no expectations and I was not disappointed |
