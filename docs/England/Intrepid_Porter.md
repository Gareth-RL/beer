| **Comments** | Cask. @the organ grinder. Abv given as 5.1% so maybe a new brew. Aroma is dark malty with a spicy note. Pours very dark with creamy tan top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium to full bodied, carbonation soft, texture creamy, and the finish bitter and long. Overall a solid porter., although modest rather than intrepid. |
