| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with thin tan lacing. Chocolate malt aroma. Taste is medium sweet to bitter: some caramel alongside the chocolate. But less sweet or decadent than many a pastry stout. Medium bodied, smooth textured, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Just a slight hint of confectioner's sugar in the finish to signal its pastry status |
