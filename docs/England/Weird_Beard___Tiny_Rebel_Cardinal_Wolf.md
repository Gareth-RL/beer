Brewer: Weird Beard Brew Co.

Comments: tap. Aroma has caramel malts amidst a float of tangerines. Appearance is
  cloudy orange with a thin lace top. Taste is initially sweet due to the combination
  of malt and citric hops noted above but the bitterness builds to medium and beyond.
  Texture is thick and finish is sticky and long. Overall an interesting combination
  of Flemish and American styles.
