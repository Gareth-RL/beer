| **Comments** | tap. Aroma has caramel malts amidst a float of tangerines. Appearance is cloudy orange with a thin lace top. Taste is initially sweet due to the combination of malt and citric hops noted above but the bitterness builds to medium and beyond. Texture is thick and finish is sticky and long. Overall an interesting combination of Flemish and American styles. |
