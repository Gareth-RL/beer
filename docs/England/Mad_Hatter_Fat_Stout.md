| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma mildly of chocolate and coffee with maybe some licorice mixed n. Pours black with tan cream head. Taste has caramelized malts with a more definite mocha component.Medium body for a stout with a slightly creamy aftertaste. Overall tasty but like most crafty pours you are looking at over Â£4 a pint &#40;there was a time when that was an evening out&#033; Admittedly not in this century&#41;. |
