| **Comments** | The scent won't sell it. Clear golden body with thin lace top. Grainy sweet taste with souring rather than crisp finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a sour finish. Not a great lager by some margin. As to why? There's a big student market in Nottingham 75k and an even bigger bottled lager market. Let's hope it and the gin cross-subsidize more interesting beers. |
