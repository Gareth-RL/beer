| **Comments** | bread, nuts, herbs, woody, scent. Pours amber with ruby lights. White lace top diminishing. Taste is lightly sweet and medium growing bitter with a sustained hop fruitiness. Palate is medium bodied,oily texture, average to soft carbonation, and a soft bitter finish. A decent cask pint but what to call it? Hardly an ESB, and not a brown ale. There&#39;s a monkey in the works. |
