Comments: '"Still mystery but the blokes at the bar drink it daily and it explains
  their robust constitution. (One 20 year-old didn''t look a day over 60. Try not
  to ask for a half, it''s code for something else. Aroma is roasted malts and berry
  hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with reasonable fruitiness. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A session bitter and
  why not? It used to be my local source of Deuchars. And one tip wear black to blend
  in."'
