Comments: Poured hazy golden thin lace top. Aroma citrus more lemon than orange and pale malt. A little grassiness. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some fruit but more malt than expected. The Brett seems to add fizz. Medium to light body smooth texture average+ carbonation and a light bitter finish. It's okay.
