Comments: '"Poured hazy golden thin lace top. Aroma citrus more lemon than orange
  and pale malt. A little grassiness. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some fruit
  but more malt than expected. The Brett seems to add fizz. Medium to light body smooth
  texture average+ carbonation and a light bitter finish. It''s okay."'
