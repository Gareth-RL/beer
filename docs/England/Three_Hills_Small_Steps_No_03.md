| **Comments** | Aroma has melon and peach and a subtle something else which might even be candyfloss, although there's a real danger of crosscontamination from a heady milkshake IPA coming up next.  Yes, this one is otherwise citric and pine. Pours regulation hazy golden with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit notes throughout. Good for 3% and another summer garden beer.  |
