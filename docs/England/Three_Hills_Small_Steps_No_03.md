Comments: '"Aroma has melon and peach and a subtle something else which might even

  milkshake IPA coming up next.  Yes, this one is otherwise citric and pine. Pours
  regulation hazy golden with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit
  notes throughout. Good for 3% and another summer garden beer. "'
