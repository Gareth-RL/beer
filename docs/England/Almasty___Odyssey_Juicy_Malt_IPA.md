| **Comments** | Cask. At Kean&#39; Head. Pours amber with off white top. Aroma has cereal, hay, bread, grass, spruce, leaves, woody, notes. Taste is medium bitter to sour with a back note of light sweetness. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. The name sums it: Juicy malt, lugubrious rather than crisp. |
