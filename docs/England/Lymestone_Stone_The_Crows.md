| **Comments** | Slightly surprised this has eluded me so long. The Scandinavians were on in 2009 for christ'ssake. Pouring dark copper body with tan lace. Aroma of berries and nutloaf. Taste is surprisingly fruity. Sweet but with a a definite transition. Bitter finish. Palate is thin to medium, smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. And yes there's chocolate malt. |
