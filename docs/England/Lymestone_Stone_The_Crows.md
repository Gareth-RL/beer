Comments: '"Slightly surprised this has eluded me so long. The Scandinavians were
  on in 2009 for christ''ssake. Pouring dark copper body with tan lace. Aroma of berries
  and nutloaf. Taste is surprisingly fruity. Sweet but with a a definite transition.
  Bitter finish. Palate is thin to medium, smooth texture average carbonation and
  a bitter finish. And yes there''s chocolate malt."'
