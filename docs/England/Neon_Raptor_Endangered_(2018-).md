Beer: Neon Raptor Endangered (2018-)
BeerID: 674536
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has the vanilla oak bourbon quality you want. Pours dark brown body
  and tan lace top. Taste is smooth sweet to lightly bitter. So the transition is
  smoother than previously. Palate is medium bodied creamy texture soft carbonation
  and a long finish. Excellent stuff.
