| **Comments** | Cask. A modest and mildly fruity aroma. Pours pale gold and from the tap thereâ€™s no head just a smattering of broken lace. So far so unimpressive. But the taste is better than the scent. With a bready malty richness and a pleasing wash upon the palate. I could spend the evening in this company, even if it would be unremarkable. |
