Beer: Cross Bay Sunset
BeerID: 156270
Brewer: Cross Bay Brewery
City: Morecambe
Comments: Cask. A modest and mildly fruity aroma. Pours pale gold and from the tap
  there’s no head just a smattering of broken lace. So far so unimpressive. But the
  taste is better than the scent. With a bready malty richness and a pleasing wash
  upon the palate. I could spend the evening in this company, even if it would be
  unremarkable.
