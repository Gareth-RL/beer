| **Comments** | Cask. Pours very pale yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma is muted floral hops. Taste is medium to full bitter with a sour note. Palate is medium to light bodied despite its oily texture, carbonation is average to soft, and the finish is bitter. Overall a big disappointment as the brewery has done some decent ale. In this instance, the most impressive thing is the correct spelling of the battle field. |
