Comments: Poured golden body white lace top. Aroma of pale malt and lemony citrus hop. Lightly sweet but rapid transition to medium pithy citrus bitter. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  It may not suit everyone- you know, Tom, Dick and the other guy. Cask @theembankment.
