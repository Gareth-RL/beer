Beer: Mordue Americana
BeerID: 290759
Brewer: Mordue Brewery
City: North Shields
Comments: Cask. Aroma pithy and malty. Pours a cloudy chestnut with a beige top that
  produces an extensive lace wash. Taste has some liquorice and roasted malts with
  hops behind. Seems a good example of a brown ale if slightly mid-Atlantic.
