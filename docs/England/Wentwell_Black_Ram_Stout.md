Beer: Wentwell Black Ram Stout
BeerID: 366849
Brewer: Wentwell Brewery
City: Derby
Comments: Cask. Aroma of roasted malts. Pours dark with ruby tints. Thin tan top.
  Tastes of caramel toffee and biscuit. Smooth and medium bodied. And at 4.1 you can
  have an evening of it. But the company would have to be better than the beer.
