| **Comments** | There is the scent of beer - malt hops yeast. No real distinction. Malt biscuit. Hops citric. Yeast earthy. Honey coloured with no head to speak of. Taste smooth balanced. Sweet notes to the fore. Salty background that causes sweetness to linger and masks the bitterness. It’s helped by the slightly pleasanter atmosphere in a pub without shrieking or smashing glass. Yet it’s still a Wetherspoons. |
