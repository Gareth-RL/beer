| **Comments** | Toffee malt aroma, edging towards butterscotch. Pours a rich ruby copper body with thing dissipating lace top. Taste is medium sweet with light bitter finish and yeasty tang. Palate is medium bodied oily to sticky feel, average to soft carbonation and a definite ester finish with light bitterness. From my novice perspective it seems to match the style guide perfectly. I guess the question mark would lie next to the term complexity. The sweet malts are there but are they sufficiently complemented by something else. Either way it's a good specimen |
