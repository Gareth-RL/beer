| **Comments** | Cask. Modestly malty on the nose. A classic bitter look. Dark orange amber body and solid white top. Taste was balanced with a tilt to malt in the fore and hops in the aft. I would lie if I said it left me wanting more perhaps the opposite and as someone who cherishes good bitter that is worrying. So it did not stand out nor meet expectations. Will re-rate at some point. |
