Beer: Great Heck Navigator
BeerID: 281057
Brewer: Great Heck Brewing
City: Goole
Comments: Cask. Modestly malty on the nose. A classic bitter look. Dark orange amber
  body and solid white top. Taste was balanced with a tilt to malt in the fore and
  hops in the aft. I would lie if I said it left me wanting more perhaps the opposite
  and as someone who cherishes good bitter that is worrying. So it did not stand out
  nor meet expectations. Will re-rate at some point.
