Comments: 'Bonfire night porter. Pour chestnut dark brown with lace top. Aroma has
  Smokey caramel malts. Hints of licorice and dried fruit. Full to medium bodied.
  But well aerated so a 5% porter that begs a second pint. 10/28/23 the second pint
  was 8 years in the making. Still a decent porter '
