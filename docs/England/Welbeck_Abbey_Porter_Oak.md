| **Comments** | Bonfire night porter. Pour chestnut dark brown with lace top. Aroma has Smokey caramel malts. Hints of licorice and dried fruit. Full to medium bodied. But well aerated so a 5% porter that begs a second pint. 10/28/23 the second pint was 8 years in the making. Still a decent porter  |
