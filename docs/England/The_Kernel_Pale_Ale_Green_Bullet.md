| **Comments** | Aroma has lemon zest and grassy hop. Pours hazy golden thin white lace top. Taste is medium bitter with light sweet hints and sour backnotes. Palate is thin, light feel, airy carbonation, bitter finish. A very interesting pale that forces you to reconsider especially the palate where normally medium is king. |
