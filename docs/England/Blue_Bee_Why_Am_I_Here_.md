| **Comments** | Aroma of grassy grapefruit twinned with bubblegum. Pours golden with white lace. Taste is strongly bitter to medium sour. Certainly more bitter than I expected. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a long bitter finish. Overall you really need to love your bitterness to drink it |
