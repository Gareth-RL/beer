Comments: Aroma of grassy grapefruit twinned with bubblegum. Pours golden with white
  lace. Taste is strongly bitter to medium sour. Certainly more bitter than I expected.
  Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a long bitter finish.
  Overall you really need to love your bitterness to drink it
