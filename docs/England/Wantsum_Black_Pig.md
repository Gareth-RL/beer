| **Comments** | Aroma has dark toffee malt and a hint of spice.  Pours dark chestnut body with off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long fruity finish.  A flavoursome beer but neither Russian nor particularly Baltic a strong mild perhaps 28 June 19 a second helping and the same opinion. Except that it seemed more porter like. The feel was thinner in the mouth though. |
