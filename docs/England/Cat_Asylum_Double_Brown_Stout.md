City: Collingham
Comments: Cask at The Hand & Heart Nottingham. Pours black with coffee creamy head.
  Aroma has roasted malts licorice and dark coffee notes. Taste is light sweet and
  medium bitter with a licorice tang. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and the bitter finish. Overall very good and I wish I knew what the
  bretting did.
