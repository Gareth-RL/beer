Beer: Grain Lignum Vitae
BeerID: 375756
Brewer: Grain Brewery
City: Harleston
Comments: Cask. Aroma resinous pine. Wafting marmalade. Pours gold with bubbly white
  top and broken lacing Rich taste of citrus fruits with sour orange to the fore and
  maltbread lurking at the rear. Tastes even stronger than its 6.5% which for me is
  the only deficit. But a fine example.
