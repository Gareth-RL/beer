Comments: '"Poured cloudy, golden body with white foam. A gusher from the can yielding
  50% foam. Aroma is predictably herbal with a hint of citrus. Taste is like a wheat
  beer that has sat too long; lightly sweet, lightly bitter, mainly meh. Palate is
  light to medium with a mouth coating chamomile tea finish. It''s not clear that
  it enhanced my calm as I am limiting myself to the occasional lunchtime ale to ensure
  they don''t interact with the nightly painkillers. So possibly not a neutral review!"'
