| **Comments** | tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Aroma has pineapple tropical hops with grapefruit zest. Pours cloudy yellow gold with white top. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Some lactic stickiness at the end. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and that odd finish. Overall good but never great. |
