| **Comments** | Poured a classic murky orange golden body with loose white foam top. Aroma of tropical citrus, with peach and mango notes. Taste is light to medium sweet but with a souring and softening into a clammy bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth wheaten transition, soft to average carbonation, and a sour bitter mash finish. Some NEIPA are so full of juicy fruitiness that each sip takes you further into the fruitbowl, but this one sours quickly and it ends with the orange juice and toothpaste combination that you may remembered from that hurried breakfast.  So not a star that will revolve in my heaven. |
