Comments: '"Tap at Brew Dog. Pours pale yellow gold with foamy white lacing. Aroma
  is fruity with some definite fig notes amidst the hedgerow fruit. Taste is medium
  sweet to stronger and it may need a counterpoint but that is largely due to its
  slightly unappealing finish. It ends with a taste that recalls childhood sweet binges.
  Palate is medium bodied, texture sticky, average carbonation, and a finish with
  a hint of vomited sugar. Until the last mouthful it&#39;s okay but don&#39;t let
  it lie."'
