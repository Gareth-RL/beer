| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy pale yellow with thin lace top. Aroma is pithy grapefruit and funky pineapple. Taste is medium sour to bitter which given the tropical fruit notes is off-putting. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to flat carbonation, and a souring finish. Another pale that flatters to deceive. |
