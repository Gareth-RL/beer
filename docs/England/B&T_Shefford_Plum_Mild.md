BeerID: 259921
Brewer: B&T Brewery
City: Shefford
Comments: Cask. Aroma modestly fruity but hardly plum plump. Pours very dark with
  creamy white top. Taste is more licorice malts than plum so plum porter fans back
  away. But one should acknowledge that its body, look and flavours are achieved in
  the low abv mild range. That takes skill.
