Beer: Hollow Stone Pale Ale
BeerID: 559393
Brewer: '"Shipstone&#39;s Beer Company"'
City: Old Basford
Comments: Pale malts and fruity hops. Pours very pale yellow gold with thin lace top.
  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and one might add that the flavour exceeded
  the palate. Thin to medium bodied light oily texture average carbonation and a clinging
  finish (often the best kind). 28/01/20 second sipping funky fruit scent otherwise
  as above.
