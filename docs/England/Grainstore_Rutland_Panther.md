Beer: Grainstore Rutland Panther
BeerID: 20706
Brewer: Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.)
City: Oakham
Comments: Cask. Pours black/dark brown with tan foam top. Aroma malty with some dark
  fruits. The taste has caramel malts with licorice notes. Could not detect chocolate.
  There is a languor on the palate but a flat one with no marked bitter finish. But
  one should bear in mind that this is a 3.4% mild and for that abv there’s plenty
  to consider.
