| **Comments** | Cask. Pours black/dark brown with tan foam top. Aroma malty with some dark fruits. The taste has caramel malts with licorice notes. Could not detect chocolate. There is a languor on the palate but a flat one with no marked bitter finish. But one should bear in mind that this is a 3.4% mild and for that abv thereâ€™s plenty to consider. |
