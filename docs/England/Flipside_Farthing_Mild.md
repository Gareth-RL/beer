Beer: Flipside Farthing Mild
BeerID: 267300
Brewer: Flipside Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma of toffee malt and berry hops. Pours dark ruby chestnut body and tan
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter in the finish. Palate is medium, sticky
  feel, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I have got to the stage where
  a decent tasting 3.6% ale is a godsend.
