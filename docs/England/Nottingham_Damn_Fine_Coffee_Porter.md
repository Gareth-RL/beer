Beer: Nottingham Damn Fine Coffee Porter
BeerID: 367477
Brewer: Nottingham Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma of vanilla and coffee grounds. Pours black with tan cream head.
  Taste is disappointing with roasted malts souring so that it like the dregs of a
  coffee rather than the first mouthful. Thin to medium bodied with a little carbonation
  in the tail. A shame since a good coffee porter is a real find.
