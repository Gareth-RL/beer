| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of vanilla and coffee grounds. Pours black with tan cream head. Taste is disappointing with roasted malts souring so that it like the dregs of a coffee rather than the first mouthful. Thin to medium bodied with a little carbonation in the tail. A shame since a good coffee porter is a real find. |
