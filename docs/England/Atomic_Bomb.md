Brewer: Atomic Brewery
City: Rugby
Comments: Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Aroma of hop fruits
  and pale malts. Pours golden with diminishing white lace. Taste is medium bitter
  to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and
  a soft sour finish. Not as pungent as promised and the well hopped finish drifts
  from bitter to sour.
