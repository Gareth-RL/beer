| **Comments** | Poured cola black with thin tan lacing. Aroma of cherry more than vanilla as well as dark malts. Taste is sweet to bitter with the vanilla at the front and the cherry lurking through to the back. Palate is medium to watery, smooth apart from a bit of dust in the finish, carbonation average, and the finish, bitter. I am always wary of these flavour boosts to established stouts and porters, especially as I like the original. Predictably, while I admit there is cherry and vanilla here, I prefer the unadorned original. If improvement is needed on the stout, it's the palate not the taste that needs a boost. 27/03/2024 second sipping and the same opinion. |
