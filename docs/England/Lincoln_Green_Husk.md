| **Comments** | Malty cereal nose. Copper bodied with thin white lace.  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a marked rye cereal note. Palate is medium bodied at best, thin feel, average to soft carbonation and a bitter grainy finish. Better than expected but unlikely to displace the core range. |
