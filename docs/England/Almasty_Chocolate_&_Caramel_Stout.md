| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. A definite chocolate and caramel with vanilla and ground coffee notes. Pours dark brown body and tan foam top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied slightly thin for a stout but creamy texture, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a sweet and flavorsome stout |
