Brewer: Partizan Brewing
City: Market Harborough
Comments: Pours pale gold with white lace top. Aroma modestly hoppy. Taste is medium
  bitter with a cask style bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a bitter finish. Apart from the colour, it could pass for a bitter
  taste wise. That is a surprise.
