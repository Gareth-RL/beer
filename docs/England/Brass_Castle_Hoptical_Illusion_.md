Brewer: Brass Castle Brewery
Aroma: 7.0
Appearance: 4.0
Taste: 6.0
Palate: 4.0
Overall: 13.0
MyScore: 3.4
Comments: Organ Grinder Cask. Poured clear golden body white lace top. Aroma white grapes and lychee and gooseberry; others find citrus but apart from lemon it escapes me. Lightly sweet to bitter with a delicate fruitiness (imagine the opposite of an NEIPA). Light, watery texture average carbonation and a dry lemon finish. Easy drinking if thin.
