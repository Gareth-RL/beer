Beer: 'Brass Castle Hoptical Illusion '
BeerID: 281243
Brewer: Brass Castle Brewery
City: Malton
Comments: Organ Grinder Cask. Poured clear golden body white lace top. Aroma white
  grapes and lychee and gooseberry; others find citrus but apart from lemon it escapes
  me. Lightly sweet to bitter with a delicate fruitiness (imagine the opposite of
  an NEIPA). Light, watery texture average carbonation and a dry lemon finish. Easy
  drinking if thin.
