| **Comments** | Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with halo of thin lace. Aroma has muted lemon and light lactose scent. Taste is medium to lightly sour. Refreshing rather than tongue curling. Palate similarly is medium bodied, some stickiness, average carbonation and a soft finish - not so much a linger as a stain. To be honest it was the only beer unreviewed that was under 8%. And it&#39;s only just 4pm. |
