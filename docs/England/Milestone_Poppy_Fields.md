Comments: 'Poured copper body white lace top.  Looks the part. Bread malt and hedgerow
  hops  scent. Light to medium sweet to bitter with more bread malt than hop in a
  close race for balanced status. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish.  In short, balanced in a way that Flanders fields were not.
  But we shall remember them '
