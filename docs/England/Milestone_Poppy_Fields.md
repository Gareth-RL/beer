| **Comments**  | Poured copper body white lace top.  Looks the part. Bread malt and hedgerow hops  scent. Light to medium sweet to bitter with more bread malt than hop in a close race for balanced status. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  In short, balanced in a way that Flanders fields were not. But we shall remember them                                                                                       |
