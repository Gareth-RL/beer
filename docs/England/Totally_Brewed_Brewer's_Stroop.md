| **Comments** | Described as a waffle stout which may explain the maple syrup on the nose. Pours black with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with caramelized malts to the fore. Palate is no more than medium, sticky feel, average to soft carbonation, bitter finish. Fair enough but not on a par with Voodoo. |
