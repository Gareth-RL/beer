Brewer: Grain Brewery
City: Harleston
Comments: Fruity aroma. Brown body thin top but steady lacing. I like more malt myself
  and this has malt foregrounded but with hops lingering on the palate for the &quot;balanced&quot;
  effect. A session bitter in my view which makes me wonder at past days when a session
  was 5 or more. But that’s age for you - the folly of youth or frailty of age who
  knows?
