| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham . Pours golden with white top. Aroma is the obligatory tropical fruit with some malt evident. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but it takes a while to get there. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a  long finish. For no good reason I am resentful of Kernel and feel they are going through the motions on a lot of brews. The big brewers do but should the craft also? |
