| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee malts and herbal hops. Pours dark brown with tan cream top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a nutty note. Palate is medium to thin bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a bitter coffee finish. Possibly an occasion when a really good preceding beer eclipsed the next.  |
