Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy amber body bubbly thin lace top. Aroma
  is more malt than hop but the fruit flavours from the NZ hops come through on the
  tongue. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium to light body  oily texture,
  average carbonation, and a bitter finish. It&#39;s not an IPA but given the provenance
  of the hops why is an American pale? Good though."'
