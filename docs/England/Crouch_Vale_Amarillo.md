Comments: '"Cask. Warning - this may be a dodgy sample. But the main &quot;wonderful&quot;
  thing about the aroma is its absence. It&#39;s lightly hoppy. Also it&#39;s a cloudy
  orange where others have had it clear and golden. The top is lace but fleeting.
  Fortunately, the taste is okay. Fruity, but with a pleasant and moderate bitterness.
  The texture is slick and the body medium to light. Carbonation soft and bitter finish.
  I have said my prayers."'
