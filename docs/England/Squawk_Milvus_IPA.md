Comments: '"Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours light gold with white lace top.
  Aroma has floral hops and pale malts. Taste is medium bitter to sour. It didn&#39;t
  finish well in my opinion . Palate is light to medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a sour finish. I should have gone for the keg version."'
