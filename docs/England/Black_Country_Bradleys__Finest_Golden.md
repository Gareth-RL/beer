Comments: '"Cask. Aroma is grassy herbal at best. Pours yellow with white top and
  yields broken lacing. Taste light to medium body with fruity notes. Soft carbonation
  and sweet finish. I had forgotten it before I finished writing this. 24/02/24 Seven
  years later, it''s improved. Citrus scent and taste more pronounced. Grainy texture
