| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is grassy herbal at best. Pours yellow with white top and yields broken lacing. Taste light to medium body with fruity notes. Soft carbonation and sweet finish. I had forgotten it before I finished writing this. 24/02/24 Seven years later, it's improved. Citrus scent and taste more pronounced. Grainy texture  |
