Brewer: Nottingham Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Earthy hoppy aroma. Pours copper with thin lace top. No great taste,
  although the water has had malt and hops added. You could have a session of this
  if you were determined enough and were drinking to forget. Given the quality of
  other Nottingham ales this one is a puzzle.
