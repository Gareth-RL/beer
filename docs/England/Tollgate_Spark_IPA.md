Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Tollgate Spark IPA
BeerID: 516176
Brewer: Tollgate Brewery
City: Ashby-de-la-Zouch
Comments: Cask. Pours amber to copper body with thin white top. Aroma has earthy,
  woody, scents but with some background fruit. Taste light sweetness and medium bitterness.
  Carbonation average to soft. Doesn’t taste like an IPA. More ESB. Frankly US hops
  is too nondescript as a descriptive term and might imply a tropical or citrus range
  that is not present here. Not bad,but for 5.6% I expect more flavour.
