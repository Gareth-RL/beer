Aroma: 7.0
Beer: '"Siren / Reuben''s Home From Home"'
BeerID: 605287
Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy murky orange with white
  foam broken lacing. Aroma has grapefruit and tropical fruit with background grainy
  notes with coffee evident only in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with
  some souring along the way. Palate is interesting being medium bodied but with a
  wash that oscillates between sticky and oily for me, carbonation is average to soft,
  and the finish with its coffee notes loiters. Admirable in some ways but more a
  trial balloon than a regular flight.
