Comments: Tropical nose with mango and melon squabbling. Pours hazy golden with white
  lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter noticeably longer. Medium
  bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Suffers by comparison
  with the Boundary Double Negative that preceded it.
