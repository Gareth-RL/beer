| **Comments** | Correcting a rating borne of the I'll judged star scheme. I misguidedly thought this was for how often you drank it: hence *. Poured dark brown with deep foam tan top. Aroma of roasted malt a little licorice a little fruit. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with backnotes of chocolate and berries. Palate is medium to full bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly a porter in the classic style if a little gassy. |
