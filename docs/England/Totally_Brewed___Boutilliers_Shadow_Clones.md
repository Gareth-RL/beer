Beer: Totally Brewed / Boutilliers Shadow Clones
BeerID: 825688
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Poured pale yellowish greenish fruit juice with rapidly diminishing lace.
  Aroma signals tea and a hint of tropical fruit. The pineapple comes through in the
  medium sweet taste although it is mainly a fruit tea with a little sourness in the
  finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation and a light
  sour finish. This falls into that huge category of contemporary beer to which earlier
  generations of Englishmen would have responded with you call that beer! It was a
  simpler time and I may well belong to it.
