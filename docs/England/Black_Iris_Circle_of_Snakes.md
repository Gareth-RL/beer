Comments: '"Tap @ Canal House Nottingham. Pours murky orange pulp with lace top. Aroma
  has citrus, melon peach and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to sour with extra
  fruit in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, average carbonation, sticky texture,
  and a lingering sour fruit finish. For me, it started great and then fell away."'
