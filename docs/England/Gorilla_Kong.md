| **Comments** | Bottle from the brewery. Poured golden brown with thin but persistent lacing. Aroma of pale malts and citrus hop. Medium sweet but the dominant note is a long crisp bitterness that extends languorously in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and the finish which to me was the most impressive and most IPA feature. This is my 4th or 5th beer from the Ape men and the overall impression is very solid and reliable stuff. Given the Gorilla theme, I do wonder if they will regret using the Kong label for an IPA this soon. I would have gone for Skyscraper, Airplane and Fay Ray before I got to the King... |
