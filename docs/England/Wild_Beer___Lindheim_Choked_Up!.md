Beer: Wild Beer / Lindheim Choked Up!
BeerID: 734594
Brewer: '"Wild Beer (Curious Brewing - St. Peter&#39;s)"'
City: Shepton Mallet
Comments: Pours raspberry red with thin lace top. Aroma of lactose funk berry fruits
  and toffee malt. An odd combination to be frank. Taste is medium sweet to sour with
  a subtlety that might pass for noise. In particular the malt is counterpuntal. But
  the fruit sweet/sour edges are well managed. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel
  soft carbonation and a sour finish. Good but not a call to the fjord.
