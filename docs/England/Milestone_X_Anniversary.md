Brewer: Milestone Brewing
City: Newark
Comments: If you like the scent of tinned prunes the aroma was made for you. Appearance
  chestnut with longer white to tan head. The taste is similarly caramels and fruit
  with a classic bitter edge. Coats the palate and has a sustained flavour. Needs
  good cellar and was served too cold for its own good.
