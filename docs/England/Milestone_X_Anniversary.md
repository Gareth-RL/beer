| **Comments** | If you like the scent of tinned prunes the aroma was made for you. Appearance chestnut with longer white to tan head. The taste is similarly caramels and fruit with a classic bitter edge. Coats the palate and has a sustained flavour. Needs good cellar and was served too cold for its own good. |
