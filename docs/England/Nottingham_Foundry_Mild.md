Comments: '"Cask. Aroma roasted malts with coffee undertones. Pours chestnut brown
  with ruby lights and thin lace top. Taste more caramel malt with a languorous smooth
  bitter finish. I would have enjoyed it even more if the double CAMRA discount had
  been offered or more prominently displayed. Mild Trail Nottingham 2024. It was bound
  to be here. More caramel than coffee this time around after 8 years. @thehoppole
  Beeston And it benefitted from grade inflation as the original 3.1 seems harsh now
  Second sipping on 2024 Trail this time at the Round Robin East Leake"'
