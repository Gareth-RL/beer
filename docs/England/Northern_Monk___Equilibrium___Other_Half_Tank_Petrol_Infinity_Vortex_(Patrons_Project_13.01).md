Comments: '"Aroma muted tropical fruits grapefruit, pineapple, melon, mango. Pours
  murky cloudy golden with white lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft carbonation, light bitter finish, but
  it doesn&#39;t grab me. I&#39;m still not convinced that double dry hopping delivers."'
