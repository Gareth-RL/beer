| **Comments** | Poured golden body white lace top. Floral hops pale bread malt. Medium sweet to bitter with a hint of citrus coming through. Medium to light body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nothing special and guessing which three hops was less entertaining than knowing  |
