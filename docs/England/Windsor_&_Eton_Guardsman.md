| **Comments** | Poured copper amber body with off-white foam. More malt than hop on the nose, with bread from the former and hedgerow from the latter. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little languor in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, average to lively carbonation, some biscuit mouth-coating lengthening the bitter finish. I made a point of sampling quite a few Bitters on my return to England and most disappointed a palate primed by too many New World pales and dark malty stouts. But this one is balanced in a good way.  |
