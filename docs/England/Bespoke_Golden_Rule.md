| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden body and thin white lace top. Aroma has something that comes perilously close to soya sauce &#40;which as this is a prelude for a Chinese, I am not offended&#41;. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. There are worse ways to use the time until your takeaway is ready. So it did its job. |
