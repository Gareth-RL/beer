| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma puzzled me since the pub was awash with fried fish smells but lurking below the batter was coffee and chocolate and berry. Pours mahogany with tan top and good lacing. Fortunately the taste was unaffected by the fishy environment and the roasted malts and fruity notes came through pleasantly. Palate was medium with some excess carbonation but overall a porter to return to. |
