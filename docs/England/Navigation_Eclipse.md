| **Comments** | Cask at the taphouse. Pours black with tan head. Aroma of caramelized malt. Taste has fruit and licorice with some biscuity notes lurking.Smooth but with a pleasant lasting edge on the palate. More porter than stout. And not to much abv to prevent tasting a few. I commend it to the house. |
