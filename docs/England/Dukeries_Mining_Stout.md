| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of prunes and licorice. Pours black to dark brown with tan top. Tastes roasted malt, dried fruit, and cough syrup. Nevertheless easy drinking with very little languor. I would have it again 19/03/19 So I did. Less impressed with the prune nose and the sticky palate. But distinctive. |
