| **Comments** | Aroma has a hint of lavender amid a citric sourness. Pours hazy pale golden body with white halo. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a medicinal quality that may deter but captures a lavender quality that may well be best left in the wild. Palate is light to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a chlorine finish. The barman muttered about old ladies handkerchiefs and I bow to his specialist knowledge. |
