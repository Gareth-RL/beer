Beer: Black Iris Lovelace
BeerID: 769096
Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has a hint of lavender amid a citric sourness. Pours hazy pale golden
  body with white halo. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a medicinal quality that
  may deter but captures a lavender quality that may well be best left in the wild.
  Palate is light to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a chlorine
  finish. The barman muttered about old ladies handkerchiefs and I bow to his specialist
  knowledge.
