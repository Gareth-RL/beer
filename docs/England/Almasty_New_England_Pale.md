| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale orange with diminishing lace top. Aroma of tropical hops and pale malts. Mango and pineapple notes. Taste is medium bitter with a sharper aspirin like finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, sticky bitter finish. Maybe it was the aspirin alongside mango that lowered my joy. Now there&#39;s a phrase you don&#39;t hear everyday. |
