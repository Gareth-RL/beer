| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma - I would suggest malteaser. Dark chestnut body tan cream head. Taste is vanilla coffee malts and a smooth creamy body. I assume this is part of stout and porter stroll featured event and given that this is a Blue Monkey pub they could just push the Guerrilla stout. -Well done&#033; |
