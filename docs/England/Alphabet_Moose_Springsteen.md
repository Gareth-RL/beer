Beer: Alphabet Moose Springsteen
BeerID: 608726
Brewer: Alphabet Brewing Co.
City: Ardwick
Comments: Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours clear golden body with white lace
  top. Aroma is the promised lactose and vanilla which favours malt over hops so the
  pineapple peach edge towards strawberry icecream in the mouth. Palate is medium
  bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a sweet to sour finish. Interesting
  and odd.
