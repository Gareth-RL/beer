Beer: Raw Dark Peak Stout
BeerID: 124740
Brewer: Silver Brewhouse (prev Raw) [Industrial Ales] [Funky Hop Donkey]
City: Chesterfield
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with thin broken lace top. Aroma is malty, roasted, chocolate
  and caramel. Taste is therefore sweet medium+, bitter chocolate finish. Texture
  is rich, smooth, and medium to full bodied. Overall the best of an indifferent excursion.
  But it would be definitely a safe stout choice.
