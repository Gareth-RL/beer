Beer: Empire Chocolate Stout
BeerID: 134854
Brewer: Empire Brewing Co.
City: Slaithwaite
Comments: Aroma has chocolate powder amid dark malt and berries. Pours rich dark brown
  with creamy tan head. Taste is sweet medium to full with a light bitter finish.
  But this is a sweet stout and no mistake. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft
  to average carbonation and a long finish with some bitterness emerging.  I was incapacitated
  for a week so I am praying this is a beer I can trust.
