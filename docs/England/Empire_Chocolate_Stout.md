| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate powder amid dark malt and berries. Pours rich dark brown with creamy tan head. Taste is sweet medium to full with a light bitter finish. But this is a sweet stout and no mistake. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish with some bitterness emerging.  I was incapacitated for a week so I am praying this is a beer I can trust. |
