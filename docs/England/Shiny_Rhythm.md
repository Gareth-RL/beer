Beer: Shiny Rhythm
BeerID: 841404
Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Hoppy, grapefruit zest and pith in the scent. Poured hazy pale yellow body
  with loose foamy white lace top. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sour as the fruit
  notes work their way through. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average
  carbonation, bitter citrus peel finish. Overall, another solid performance from
  the Shiny happy people. I can imagine a pleasant summer session in a beer garden
  with this beer for company; sadly I will have to leave it to my imagination for
  the moment.
