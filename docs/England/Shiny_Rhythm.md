| **Comments** | Hoppy, grapefruit zest and pith in the scent. Poured hazy pale yellow body with loose foamy white lace top. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sour as the fruit notes work their way through. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation, bitter citrus peel finish. Overall, another solid performance from the Shiny happy people. I can imagine a pleasant summer session in a beer garden with this beer for company; sadly I will have to leave it to my imagination for the moment. |
