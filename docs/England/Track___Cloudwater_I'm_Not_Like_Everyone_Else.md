Comments: Keg at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy yellow orange with white lace
  top. Aroma is citrus hops and apricot. Taste is medium sweet. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture, soft to average carbonation, juicy souring finish. It grows on you.
  But is it unlike anything else ? I doubt that
