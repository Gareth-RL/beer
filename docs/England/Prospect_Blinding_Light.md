Comments: If you stewed citrus this might be noted in the scent. Pale golden body
  with thin lace top. Taste is medium marmalade sweet to bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. I am
  aware that once I would have drunk it without a second thought. But the times have
  changed....
