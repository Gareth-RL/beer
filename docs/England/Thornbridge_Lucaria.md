| **Comments** | Tap at the Derby Winter Beer Festival. Pours murky chestnut with no lacing. Aroma has malt but very lactic with hints of bubble gum. Taste has toffee and other caramel notes and you can see where the ice cream goes in the languor on the palate. A pleasant novelty 08/02/24 still good 7 years later  |
