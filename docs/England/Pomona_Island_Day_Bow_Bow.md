| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange milkshake with foamy white lace top. Aroma has the proverbial tropical hops nose. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and bitter /sour languor. Not bad exactly but it adds to my mistrust of double hopping. Why bother? |
