Beer: Pomona Island Day Bow Bow

Brewer: Pomona Island Brew Co.
City: Salford
Comments: Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange milkshake with foamy
  white lace top. Aroma has the proverbial tropical hops nose. Taste is medium sweet
  to lightly sour bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation
  and bitter /sour languor. Not bad exactly but it adds to my mistrust of double hopping.
  Why bother?
