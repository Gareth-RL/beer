| **Comments**  | Poured dark chestnut body tan lace top. Aroma of milky chocolate fudge. Taste is predictably sweet with fudge in abundance and this muddies the transition to light bitter finish. Medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish with a fudge injection! You have got to like your fudge.                                                                                      |
