Comments: 'Cask. Pours golden. Thin head broken lacing. Aroma citrus lemon and grapefruit.
  Fruit carries in the taste so this a sweet hop session bitter. Medium bodied with
  only a slight bitter aftertaste on the palate. Unspectacular but sound. Safe but
  unsought after - a phrase to condemn us all '
