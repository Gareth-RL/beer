| **Comments** | Starbeer aged in a rum barrel for a year. So the original was not a milk stout but a peanut stout. That explains the scent. It pours black bodied with tan lace top. The taste is medium to full sweetness with nutty earthy biscuit notes. The palate is medium bodied, slick smooth feel if anything which was unexpected. Carbonation soft to average. It's smooth enough for an 11.5% imperial but I do wonder whether the barrel ageing delivered. My third was too much. |
