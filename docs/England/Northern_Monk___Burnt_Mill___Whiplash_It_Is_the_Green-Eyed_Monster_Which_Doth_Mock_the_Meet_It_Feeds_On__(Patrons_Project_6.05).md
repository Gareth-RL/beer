  Mock the Meet It Feeds On  (Patrons Project 6.05)
BeerID: 612668
Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.
City: Leeds
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale orange with white lace. Aroma has
  funky citrus, blood orange and grapefruit predominate. Taste juicy fruit souring
  to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily feel, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.
  It certainly looks more like an American pale even a New England one, but with collaborations
  it can be a guess. In any case it goes down easily.
