Beer: 'Meantime Pale Ale '
BeerID: 51741
Brewer: Meantime Brewing (Asahi)
City: Greenwich
Comments: Tap. Floral hops with citric nites. Amber ale with thin white top. Tastes
  soapy and fruity with muted biscuit undertones. The flavours grow fruitier and so
  does the carbonation. This may well appeal to a younger market so ker-Ching to all
  involved.
