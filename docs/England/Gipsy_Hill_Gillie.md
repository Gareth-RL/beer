| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours clear golden with white lace top. Aroma has roasty, cereal, malt and spruce, resin, hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Clean crisp drinking that makes this a deceptively potent pale ale. |
