Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Neon Raptor Island Party
BeerID: 623382
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.
City: Nottingham
Comments: Pours cloudy golden body with white lace. Aroma has citrus and tropical
  fruit pineapples papayas and passionfruit. Taste has more tangerine and grapefruit
  and a grainy note. Texture is impressive, medium to full bodied, clammy feel, long
  bitter finish. So after two beers that use oats and wheat to give body to DDHIPA,
  I commend it to the House.
