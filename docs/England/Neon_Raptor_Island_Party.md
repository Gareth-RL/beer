| **Comments** | Pours cloudy golden body with white lace. Aroma has citrus and tropical fruit pineapples papayas and passionfruit. Taste has more tangerine and grapefruit and a grainy note. Texture is impressive, medium to full bodied, clammy feel, long bitter finish. So after two beers that use oats and wheat to give body to DDHIPA, I commend it to the House. |
