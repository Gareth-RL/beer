Comments: 'Cask. Pours golden with thin white top. Aroma is muted but marmalade and
  lemon detected. Taste is marked largely by fruit - imagine marmalade thinly spread
  and a sour palate. The only puzzle here is why add a beer that is so far from the
  Infinity in quality? 20/03/2024 new batch is 4.7 abv. Maris Otter malt. Endeavour
  Harlequin and Mystic hops. The result has bread malt nose.  Light toffee and hedgerow
  hops in the taste. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  I forgive my first tasting but it is still average '
