| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden with thin white top. Aroma is muted but marmalade and lemon detected. Taste is marked largely by fruit - imagine marmalade thinly spread and a sour palate. The only puzzle here is why add a beer that is so far from the Infinity in quality? 20/03/2024 new batch is 4.7 abv. Maris Otter malt. Endeavour Harlequin and Mystic hops. The result has bread malt nose.  Light toffee and hedgerow hops in the taste. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I forgive my first tasting but it is still average  |
