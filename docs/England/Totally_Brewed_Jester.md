| **Comments** | Part of their single hop series. Aroma is herbal hay hop with biscuit malt. Pours pale gold with white lace hop. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a biscuit bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall a decent session ale but not proof that single hop is superior to a blend. |
