Brewer: St. Austell Brewery
City: St. Austell
Comments: Cask. Subtle aroma of apricot peach and sweet malts. Pours golden with thin
  bubbly top. Taste is similarly fruit with peach blending towards strawberry and
  the aeration keeps these flavours above the caramelized hops but at the end the
  palate registers an abrupt if biscuity bitterness. So a bit like apricot ham on
  toast liquefied and that makes the 5.2abv all the more cider like for a Cornish
  Christmas beer.
