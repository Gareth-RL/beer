| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured pale golden with full white foam lace. Aroma of orange sherbet predominates among the hop notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with hints of peach and pineapple along the way. Medium bodied, slightly grainy feel, average carbonation, and a dry finish. Not sure why the store had it in November since it is listed as an occasional early Spring ale--maybe there were just too many rabbits this year. |
