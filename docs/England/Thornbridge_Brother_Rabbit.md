Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Bottle. Poured pale golden with full white foam lace. Aroma of orange sherbet
  predominates among the hop notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with hints of
  peach and pineapple along the way. Medium bodied, slightly grainy feel, average
  carbonation, and a dry finish. Not sure why the store had it in November since it
  is listed as an occasional early Spring ale--maybe there were just too many rabbits
  this year.
