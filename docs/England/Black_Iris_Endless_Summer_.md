| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma pineapple mango and other fruits tropical. Yellow pale with white foam top. Lacing. Tastes as expected of the citric flavoured hops. The sparkle is there as befits a pale that evokes sunnier days. Drinking it with snow outside. Easy swallow 24/11/23 five years later. Very lively in the can. Froth everywhere but still light and summery  |
