| **Comments** | Aroma citrus floral hops. Pale golden body thin lace top. Medium sweet to bitter with more citrus than #2 but more orange than grapefruit. Light to medium bodied slightly watery texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. One can only hope that this doesn't end up a beer by committee - bland and dull  |
