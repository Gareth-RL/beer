| **Comments** | Cask. Tropical fruit aroma. Amber body white head. &#40;I confess this was drunk alongside a JDW fried chicken meal&#41;. This may have influenced the taste accentuating the fruit. The perils of being a ’one trick pony’ depend on the trick, and Oakham have gone for the fruit hop trick. And it’s a good trick. I smelt pineapples and I tasted melon and grapefruit. And it did the chicken no harm &#40;given the obvious harm it had previously experienced.&#41;. Anyway it won’t displace Cintra. |
