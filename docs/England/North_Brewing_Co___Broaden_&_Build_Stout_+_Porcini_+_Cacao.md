| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body dusty top. Aroma has cocoa dark malts and something funky if not exactly mushroomy. Taste is richly chocolate so medium + sweetness and this slowly dissolves like a chocolate liquor. Palate is medium bodied silky smooth texture soft carbonation and a long finish. A dessert. |
