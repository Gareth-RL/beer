Brewer: Liquid Light Brewing Company

Comments: The hops make this stout aromatically odd mango and pineapple and melon
  amid the dark malt. Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Medium sweet to bitter
  with chocolate and coffee competing with the fruit. Certainly I have not had a stout
  like it.
