Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Hook Norton / Birrificio MC-77 Mild The Gap
BeerID: 488959
Brewer: Hook Norton Brewery
City: Hook Norton
Comments: Cask. Pours dark mahogany body with ruby lights. Tan top. Aroma is roasted
  malts and floral hops. Taste is malty with roasted chocolate and caramel malt evident.
  As Italian beer is often made to match food. I was trying to think what would be
  the dish of choice. Meat not fish or pasta.so in JDW probably a burger or some other
  grilled offering. Maybe even the all day breakfast.
