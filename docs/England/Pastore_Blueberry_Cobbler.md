| **Comments** | Poured unclear purple body off white lace top. Aroma of berry and cinnamon. Medium sweet to sour with plenty of ginger to enliven the palate . The berries are certainly there and the spices but the vanilla is subtle. Medium to full mouth coating jam texture and a lingering finish. Cleverly done but in a blind tasting I wouldn't know it was beer. |
