Comments: '"Poured unclear purple body off white lace top. Aroma of berry and cinnamon.
  Medium sweet to sour with plenty of ginger to enliven the palate . The berries are
  certainly there and the spices but the vanilla is subtle. Medium to full mouth coating
  jam texture and a lingering finish. Cleverly done but in a blind tasting I wouldn''t
  know it was beer."'
