| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours a very cloudy orange juice yellow gold with off white lace top. Aroma has mainly softer tropical fruits papayas mango lychee passionfruit with the usual grapefruit pith to bulk it out. Taste is medium sweet with some souring but no real bitterness. Fruity tang. Palate is medium bodied, oily to sticky feel, soft carbonation, and a long finish. I admired it in spite of myself &#40;twas ever thus&#41;. |
