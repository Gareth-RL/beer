| **Comments** | Bready grainy aroma. Poured amber with off white tan headed lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with more malt evident than hops. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I have nothing against this beer but I also have very little for it. Whatever Hawaiian red means, it's safe to drink. Second sipping 8/02/22 slightly sourer mash than I remember. |
