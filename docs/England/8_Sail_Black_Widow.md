| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of burned malts like an ashtray washed in cough syrup. Ruby chestnut body with white cream head. The liquorice comes through richly in a viscous wash with some sweet biscuit below. It is certainly distinctive and true to its type but has a somewhat acrid finish. Pity. 18/11/19 second sipping no improvement. |
