Brewer: 8 Sail Brewery
City: Heckington
Comments: Cask. Aroma of burned malts like an ashtray washed in cough syrup. Ruby
  chestnut body with white cream head. The liquorice comes through richly in a viscous
  wash with some sweet biscuit below. It is certainly distinctive and true to its
  type but has a somewhat acrid finish. Pity. 18/11/19 second sipping no improvement.
