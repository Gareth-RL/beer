Comments: '"Cask at the Organ Grinder Nottingham. Pours clear golden with medium white
  foam lace top. Taste has floral lemon hops and pale malt to produce medium bitter
  increasing sour beer that is refreshing and good. Palate slick feel, soft carbonation,
  long finish. Maybe it''s the hint of lager that makes me less generous."'
