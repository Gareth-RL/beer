| **Comments**  | Boy can this one offend the cognoscenti, especially Scandinavian. The less sensitive palate accept it as a summer expedient. Poured golden body fading white lace. The peach essence or whatever flavour was poured into the vat is there in a way that yells Artificial. Sweet until it lapses into a clammy syrup finish. Light sticky but carbonation offsets that; and a sticky finish in which the syrup returns. A summer cooler item so why is it on sale at the Good Fellow George in February?                                                                                      |
