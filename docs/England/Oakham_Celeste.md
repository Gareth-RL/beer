Comments: '"Poured golden body white lace top.  Citrus scent but grapefruit and blackcurrant
  don''t blend well. Lightly sweet to bitter with grapefruit pith evident. Medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Good to see a different
  Oakham ale but it won''t eclipse Citra."'
