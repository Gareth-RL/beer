Comments: 'Pours clear golden with white lace top. No great scent light herbal grassy
  note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. The taste belies its strength. Palate
  is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. A
  decent enough pale and Vegan too. But  why single hop? '
