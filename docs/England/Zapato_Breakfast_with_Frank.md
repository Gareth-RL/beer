| **Comments** | Belgian Breakfast IPA. Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale yellow with white lace halo. Aroma is citric with orange predominantly. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not sure what a breakfast IPA is or if this is different from Farmhouse but it is palatable enough. |
