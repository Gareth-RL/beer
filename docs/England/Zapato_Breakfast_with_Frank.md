Comments: Belgian Breakfast IPA. Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale yellow with
  white lace halo. Aroma is citric with orange predominantly. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter
  finish. Not sure what a breakfast IPA is or if this is different from Farmhouse
  but it is palatable enough.
