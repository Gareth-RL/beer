Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.

Comments: Cask. Aroma of stewed plums and malt biscuit. Ruby brown with little head
  to speak of. Tastes of bready malt loaf with less fruit than in the scent. I haven’t
  seen it offered before, pleasant if unspectacular. 09/05/18 still unspectacular.
  11/22/23 five years later. On the 60th anniversary of JFK assassination a safe Mild
  seems apt!
