| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of stewed plums and malt biscuit. Ruby brown with little head to speak of. Tastes of bready malt loaf with less fruit than in the scent. I havenâ€™t seen it offered before, pleasant if unspectacular. 09/05/18 still unspectacular. 11/22/23 five years later. On the 60th anniversary of JFK assassination a safe Mild seems apt! |
