Comments: '"Cask. Aroma sour funky cheese &#40;I kid not&#41;. A golden amber pale
  with white top and lace wash. Taste is hoppy but with a soft rather than crisp quality.
  Whether this enhances the session quality you can judge for yourself but to my mind
  it dampened qualities that I like in a pale. So given that I have a good opinion
  of Whim generally this was an opportunity missed "'
