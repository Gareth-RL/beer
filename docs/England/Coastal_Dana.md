Brewer: Coastal Brewery
City: Redruth
Comments: Cask. Floral hops. Pours golden with white frothy top that leaves broken
  lace. A crisp hoppy taste with some acidity in the ending. Possibly more inspiring
  if the pub overlooked a Cornish quayside rather than the Derby Rd Nottingham. Nit
  a golden ale I will seek out.
