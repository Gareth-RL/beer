Comments: '"Porter is my favorite beer style and yet it is not always easy to find
  or when it is available bottled it is amplified to imperial or flavored lavishly
  so this appealed. It pours a very dark brown with a thin off white lace top. The
  aroma is sharply roasted malt; I did not get chocolate as proffered in the description,
  although a hint of vanilla lurked in the background. What is striking is its bitterness.
  Coffee grounds?--it''s been a while since I tasted any. But certainly it lets the
  palate know that it is not to be messed with. Medium bodied average carbonation
  and a long finish. I must be weakening as I doubt I can manage a pint."'
