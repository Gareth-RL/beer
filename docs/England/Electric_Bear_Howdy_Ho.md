Beer: Electric Bear Howdy Ho
BeerID: 571208
Brewer: Electric Bear Brewing Co
City: Bath
Comments: Tap at the Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours murky brown with little to no lacing.
  Aroma is resin, spruce, nuts, bread, cereal, leather, with light caramel malt notes.
  Taste is medium sweet and bitter with some sweetness persisting. Palate is medium
  bodied,oily feel, average carbonation, bitter, finish but understated languor. On
  the board as an American Brown so a hybrid.
