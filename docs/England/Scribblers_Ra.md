| **Comments** | Fruity apple spicy scent. Poured a pale amber body with thin lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to dusty bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. I guess I would have listed this as an amber ale along British lines with some biscuit malt evident. By Scribblers' standards, which in my experience is often malt led, this is a more hoppy brew. But the honeyed malts come through. One for the garden.  Having said that, it seemed an old-fashioned brew both in terms of its aroma and its finish. Perhaps my palate has got spoilt by the many IPAs that offer a hop mix that really deliver the aromas and length of finish that makes a beer so pleasurable. The bitter grainy notes within this as well as the colour made me opt for the international amber label but I would not like to defend it in court. |
