| **Comments** | Cask at The Organ Grinder. Pours dark brown with bubbly tan top. Aroma is syrupy vanilla and milk chocolate. Taste is medium sweet with background bitter note. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a sweet finish. Of the variant guerrilla ales, this is the least successful. I'd choose the original over this. |
