Comments: '"Cask at The Organ Grinder. Pours dark brown with bubbly tan top. Aroma
  is syrupy vanilla and milk chocolate. Taste is medium sweet with background bitter
  note. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a sweet finish.
  Of the variant guerrilla ales, this is the least successful. I''d choose the original
  over this."'
