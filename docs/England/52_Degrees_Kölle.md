| **Comments**  | Poured clear golden thin off white lace. Aroma grassy hop and pale malts. Medium to sour bitter some bread malt and a tang of hops in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It's not likely to make me want to drink Kolsch                                                                                       |
