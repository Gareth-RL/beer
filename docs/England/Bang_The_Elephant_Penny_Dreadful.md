| **Comments** | Poured black body tan cream lace top. A picturebook stout. Aroma roasted malts with toffee and chocolate notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more chocolate and a hint of licorice. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Very good. From one of my new favourite brewers  |
