| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma is complex essentially grapefruit marmalade dipped in a caramel sauce gently. Pours murky orange amber with a white top. There’s more of a wash than I expected from an American pale beer. The lacing is strong. Taste is more caramelized but the fruit lingers in a pleasantly souring mash. I could easily get carried away by this stuff and the knowledge that this is literally true gives me pause. |
