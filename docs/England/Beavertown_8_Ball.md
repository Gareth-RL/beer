Comments: Keg. Aroma is complex essentially grapefruit marmalade dipped in a caramel
  sauce gently. Pours murky orange amber with a white top. There’s more of a wash
  than I expected from an American pale beer. The lacing is strong. Taste is more
  caramelized but the fruit lingers in a pleasantly souring mash. I could easily get
  carried away by this stuff and the knowledge that this is literally true gives me
  pause.
