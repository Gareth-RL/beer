| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden body thin fading lace. Peach mango pineapple scent. Medium sweet to bitter with lots of fruit. Medium bodied, fizzy on the tongue, average carbonation, and a light bitter finish. Despite the gassy feeling, it's a refreshing pale. 07/06/24 second sipping and i still approve the scent and taste albeit i also picked up some chlorophenol in there.  And way too fizzy  |
