Comments: 'Tap at the Canal House. . Pour clear golden body with white lace top. Aroma
  fruity  - melon peach tangerine and grapefruit . Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, and a  soft finish;
  more a coating than a languor. For Thornbridge this is going through the motions.
