| **Comments**  | Poured black body tan halo.  Aroma of citrus and melon (unexpected in a dark beer but these are NZ hops). Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more fruit mandarin and lime and maybe kiwi. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I suspect it would be more interesting if I had the patience to let my keg third warm, but for the novice a black beer with this range of fruit messes with my head.                                                                                      |
