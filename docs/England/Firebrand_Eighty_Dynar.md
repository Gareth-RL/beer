| **Comments** | Labeled a dark ale on the bar and Untapped but looks like a reddish amber without Belgian strength or pretensions. Light caramel malt nose. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a mishmash of grain and fruit. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a sour finish. Not sure what to make of it |
