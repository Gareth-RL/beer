| **Comments** | Cask. Black with thin tan cream head that coats rather than laces the glass. Aroma is subtle but thereâ€™s blackcurrant and biscuit. The fruity note is even more pronounced in the taste which is infused with dark fruit alongside a creamy texture and underlying hop bitterness. Slightly gassy for a stout, but certainly of interest. |
