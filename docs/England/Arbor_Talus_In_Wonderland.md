Beer: Arbor Talus In Wonderland
BeerID: 951950
Brewer: Arbor Ales
City: Bristol
Comments: Pours hazy golden body with white foam top. Aroma has nectarine, grapefruit
  and floral notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with piney notes sharpening the
  bitterness after a citrus beginning. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. A refreshing APA just right for the return (or
  is that arrival) of summer in England.
