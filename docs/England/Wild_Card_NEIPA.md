| **Comments** | Aroma is eponymous to the brewer. A wild card of fruit with peaches high. Pours murky golden with some lasting lacing.  Taste is medium sweet with a bit of a fruitgum languor before the bitterness settles itself and arranges the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation with some fizz and a bitter finish. So an NEIPA that implies that this is a new style rather than a fading one. If by fading one means hybridising every IPA around   |
