Comments: '"A tribute to Nutella. Aroma has chocolate and cacao powder and hazelnut.
  Poured black with thin tan lace. Taste is full to medium sweet and lightly bitter.
  The chocolate and vanilla notes dominate initially and the nuts rule the finish.
  Palate is medium bodied average carbonation smooth texture and a nutty finish. It
  does what it promises. I would have liked a richer finish but that''s a counsel
  of perfection"'
