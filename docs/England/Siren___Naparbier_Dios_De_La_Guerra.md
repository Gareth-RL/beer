Comments: '"Bottle. Pours red, amber sparking body with thin lace top. Aroma is interesting
  since the array of floral notes including chamomile lend it a grass and hay nose
  with a herbal finish. Taste is light sweetness, medium bitterness, umami background.
  Palate has medium body, sticky feel, average to lively carbonation, and a long finish.
  Certainly a beer that warrants savoring with lots to consider. I probably wouldn&#39;t
  have known that it was chamomile and hibiscus but once you do, they are certainly
  there. But there is a rich maltiness here as well that is a plus in its own right.
  Not sure about the title - flores de primavera would work better."'
