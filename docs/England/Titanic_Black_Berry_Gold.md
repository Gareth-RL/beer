Brewer: Titanic Brewery (UK)
City: Stoke-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Aroma decidedly brambly. Pours a honey gold with white top. Pleased
  to see they still brand it as bitter rather than the ubiquitous blonde or gold.
  The berries are there in the taste too but although they sweeten initially I felt
  that ultimately they sharpened the bitterness This leads to a slightly acrid finish.
  A novelty but skillfully done.
