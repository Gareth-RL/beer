BeerID: 453871
Brewer: Robinsons Family Brewery
City: Stockport
Comments: Cask. Aroma berry fruits and malts. Pours chestnut with ruby lights and
  white foam top. Taste was surprisingly sweet and fruity with a mild licorice finish.
  No chocolate for me nor any of the promised warming effect. So don’t trust the commercial
  description.
