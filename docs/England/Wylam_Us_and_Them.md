Beer: Wylam Us and Them
BeerID: 596883
Brewer: Wylam Brewery
City: Newcastle upon Tyne
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught. Pours cloudy orange with thin white lace. Aroma
  is papayas peaches and grapefruit pith amidst the general hop fest. Palate is medium
  bodied, texture is oily, carbonation soft, with a crisp bitter finish. The bitterness
  grows in the sipping but there is a solid craftsmanship evident. They know how to
  do this.
