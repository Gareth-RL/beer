| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught. Pours cloudy orange with thin white lace. Aroma is papayas peaches and grapefruit pith amidst the general hop fest. Palate is medium bodied, texture is oily, carbonation soft, with a crisp bitter finish. The bitterness grows in the sipping but there is a solid craftsmanship evident. They know how to do this. |
