| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black with tan lace halo. Aroma has coffee chocolate and licorice notes but with some herbal qualities in the background. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a veritable wrestling match for control of the taste buds. Palate is medium bodied with oily feel soft to average carbonation, and a tangy finish. So impressive stuff. |
