Beer: Wild Weather Perun
BeerID: 535947
Brewer: Wild Weather Ales
City: Aldermaston Stoke
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black with tan lace halo. Aroma has coffee chocolate
  and licorice notes but with some herbal qualities in the background. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with a veritable wrestling match for control of the taste buds.
  Palate is medium bodied with oily feel soft to average carbonation, and a tangy
  finish. So impressive stuff.
