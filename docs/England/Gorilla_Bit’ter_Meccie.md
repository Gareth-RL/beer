| **Comments**  | Bottle from the brewery. Poured copper body off white thin lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt and hedgerow hops. Medium sweet to bitter some toasted malt some berry fruit but the abiding impression is the sour mash finish. Yep, it's a bitter. Medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Once all beer was like this.                                                                                      |
