Comments: '"Bottle from the brewery. Poured copper body off white thin lacing. Aroma
  of biscuit malt and hedgerow hops. Medium sweet to bitter some toasted malt some
  berry fruit but the abiding impression is the sour mash finish. Yep, it''s a bitter.
  Medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Once all beer was
  like this."'
