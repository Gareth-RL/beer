Comments: '"Aroma has dark malts aplenty. Pours black bodied with tan lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter with a licorice edge.  Palate is medium bodied clammy
  feel soft carbonation and a long bitter finish. This sours a little and may flirt
  with oatmeal stout. 02/12/22 it''s the weather for a dark ale 20/03/24 still damp
  and grey weather but the porter is a consolation "'
