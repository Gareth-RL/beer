| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma has butterscotch, citrus, and pine. Pours a cloudy pale orange amber with white foam that yields little lace. Fruit is foreground with some grapefruit bitterness before a sweet lactic finish. Enjoyable yet perplexing. I expect contemporary pale to be fruity but there is another note here that registers on the malt scale. Soft finish. |
