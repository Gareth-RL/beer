Beer: Deya / Hillside Armed With Love
BeerID: 515100
Brewer: Deya Brewing Company
City: Cheltenham
Comments: Keg. Aroma has butterscotch, citrus, and pine. Pours a cloudy pale orange
  amber with white foam that yields little lace. Fruit is foreground with some grapefruit
  bitterness before a sweet lactic finish. Enjoyable yet perplexing. I expect contemporary
  pale to be fruity but there is another note here that registers on the malt scale.
  Soft finish.
