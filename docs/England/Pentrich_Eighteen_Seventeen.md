Beer: Pentrich Eighteen Seventeen
BeerID: 359990
Brewer: Pentrich Brewing Co.
City: Pentrich
Comments: Cask at the Hand and Heart. Pours amber with foamy off white top. Aroma
  of caramel malts and citric hops. Taste is medium sweet that eventually melts to
  light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied with sticky texture, average carbonation,
  and a dull finish with all the languor of a fart in a lift. That is harsh but the
  brewer has taken ingredients that push too much along a common but not well paired
  pathway and the result is sickly.
