| **Comments** | Poured rich red chestnut body tan lace top. Definite cherry essence scent.  Medium to full sweet initially with more of a collapse than a transition to a bitter sour finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I remember back in the day regarding the Plum Porter as glorious, which reflected the times. This is equally cherry but times have changed.  |
