| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is nicely mixed biscuit and hops. Appearance light copper which I donâ€™t associate with mild as it favours the ruby dark end of the spectrum. A thin top with broken lace. Taste is caramel and toffee with the bitterness pushed very much to the back although it lingers nicely. For those who like a curtain finish rather than a guillotine edge this will suit. Overall, it makes me want to taste their bitter. |
