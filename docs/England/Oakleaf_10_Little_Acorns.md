Brewer: Fallen Acorn Brewing Co.
City: Gosport
Comments: Cask. Aroma is nicely mixed biscuit and hops. Appearance light copper which
  I don’t associate with mild as it favours the ruby dark end of the spectrum. A thin
  top with broken lace. Taste is caramel and toffee with the bitterness pushed very
  much to the back although it lingers nicely. For those who like a curtain finish
  rather than a guillotine edge this will suit. Overall, it makes me want to taste
  their bitter.
