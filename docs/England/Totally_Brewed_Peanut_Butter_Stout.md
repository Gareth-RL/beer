Comments: Cask version at 5% abv. Lightly nutty earthy scent. Poured dark brown body
  with creamy tan lace. Taste is no more than medium sweet with a decent bitterness,
  even some light licorice notes. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. A dab of peanut butter but nothing overwhelming.
