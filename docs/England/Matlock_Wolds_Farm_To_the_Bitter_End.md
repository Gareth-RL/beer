BeerID: 940468
Brewer: Matlock Wolds Farm Brewery
City: Matlock
Comments: Pours a ruby chestnut body with tan lacing. Aroma has earthy nutty notes
  with the grassy hops pushed to the background, Taste is lightly sweetly but quickly
  sours to a longer lasting bitterness that some might describe as classic English
  twig. Palate is medium bodied, lip-smacking is the best way to describe the feel,
  carbonation is average and there is indeed a long bitter finish. I am trying to
  re-immerse myself in English bitter now I am back in Blighty. And it is at least
  pleasing to note that there are some new efforts lurking behind the mass stacks
  of IPA, Goldens, and American variants. Whether they please is less certain. This
  did take me back to younger days when this was all there was.
