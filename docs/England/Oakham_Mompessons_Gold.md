Comments: Clear, but more amber than golden to my eyes.  Scummy lace top. Modest scent
  of floral hops. Medium sweet to bitter with a rich malt background.  Medium bodied
  smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Pleasant enough but
  hardly a blonde.  I worry it might be a barrel end
