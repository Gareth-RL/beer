| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark chestnut with tan foam head. Aroma is malts rather than chocolate although that is in the taste. Taste is medium bitter with a lasting sour finish. Palate is slick medium bodied and astringent sour finish. Not what I was expecting in a chocolate porter in terms of richness smoothness or sweetness. |
