| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has the full tropical citrus hops. Pours cloudy pale orange with white lace. Taste is surprisingly sour and bitter but with some light background sweetness to offset this, but my expectations were reversed. Palate is medium bodied,sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a certain sour languor. I retain an ambivalence towards NEIPA. Is it an APA or IPA that mutated unexpectedly? I see there are cans of it in the chiller. A statement of intent, indeed. |
