| **Comments** | Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Apologies to anyone who took my two stars as opinion rather than my notation that I had drunk it twice. Aroma is fruity hops with resinous and floral notes modestly in evidence. A fine clear, golden body with thin white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a languid finish. Not the apocalypse I was expecting  but far far better than 2* |
