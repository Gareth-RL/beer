BeerID: 194438
Brewer: Colchester Brewery
City: Colchester
Comments: Cask. Aroma has some cocoa and caramel amidst the general maltiness. It
  is a dark ruby mild as a lift to the light quickly proves. Taste retains the roasted
  malts preponderance but with softer fruit undertones that add to the lingering sweetness.
  While unspectacular this is a good example of a style that can be elusive and which
  has a place in a world gone pale.
