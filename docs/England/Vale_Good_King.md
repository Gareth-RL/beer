Comments: '"Cask. Aroma is hopefully not its strength. Muted nut, bread. Cellar notes.
  Pours chestnut to amber with a creamy beige top. Taste is classic nutty bitter with
  a hint of bubblegum at the end. For any foreigner who stumbles upon this page. Belgians
  do good Christmas beer but English brewers do winter ales and abysmal seasonal special
  beers for Christmas. This is above average for the latter and below for the former.
  Whenever I use former and latter in this way I am back in my Latin class at school
  &#40;it’s not a good feeling.&#41;"'
