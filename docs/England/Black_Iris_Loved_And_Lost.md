| **Comments**  | Poured dark amber brown body thin lace top. Roasted malts toffee scent. Medium sweet to bitter with more caramel and some fruit. Medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Trying to boost my Black iris intake which is low for a Nottingham drinker but this isn't inspiring me.                                                                                      |
