| **Comments** | First a confession: I don't regularly eat ramen and so I can't spot Yuzu at fifty paces. This smells lime and pineapple to me. It pours a hazy orange golden body with white lace. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I tell students - beware short questions. Like what is truth? Likewise, beware beer with long titles. |
