Beer: Black Hole Red Dwarf
BeerID: 70747
Brewer: Black Hole Brewery
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Cask at The Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours copper red brown body and
  thin lace top. Aroma is muted but the classic bitter blend of biscuit malts and
  hedgerow hops is evident. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied,oily
  texture, average carbonation, and a light sour finish. As a fan of Lister and his
  cosmic companions I wish this were less holographic.
