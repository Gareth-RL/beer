| **Comments** | Cask at The Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours copper red brown body and thin lace top. Aroma is muted but the classic bitter blend of biscuit malts and hedgerow hops is evident. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied,oily texture, average carbonation, and a light sour finish. As a fan of Lister and his cosmic companions I wish this were less holographic. |
