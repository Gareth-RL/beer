| **Comments** | Cask. A deep copper ale with a full foam top. Sweet aroma with toffee notes. Taste has some fruit and a backbone of bitter but the biscuit and caramel flavours predominate. On the palate itâ€™s medium to full bodied with a slick feel and lively carbonation. This may detract from its appeal as a session bitter. Certainly it has quelled my urge for a second. But give me a minute... 18/02/24 over 8 years so due a second sipping. Much the same but I have mellowed and hence the score has gone up from 3.3 to 3.5. pleasantly malty. |
