Beer: Ilkley Joshua Jane
BeerID: 187719
Brewer: Ilkley Brewery
City: Ilkley
Comments: Poured a rich copper body with thin lace top. Aroma has biscuit malts and
  berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to drying twiggy bitter. This is either a proof
  of its classic bitter status or a feature that might detract from its session worthiness.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and yep the bitter finish.
  I know that one should rate within the parameters of the style but clearly my tastes
  are no longer suited to classic bitters. I accept this as evolution not deterioration.
