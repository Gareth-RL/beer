| **Comments** | Poured a rich copper body with thin lace top. Aroma has biscuit malts and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to drying twiggy bitter. This is either a proof of its classic bitter status or a feature that might detract from its session worthiness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and yep the bitter finish. I know that one should rate within the parameters of the style but clearly my tastes are no longer suited to classic bitters. I accept this as evolution not deterioration. |
