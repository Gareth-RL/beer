| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark copper amber with off white lace top. Aroma has spice and hop fruits. Taste is medium sweet to light bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to soft carbonation, spicy finish. Christmas enough for me&#033; And I don&#39;t know what they gave fonefan but this is different. |
