Beer: Buxton Extra Porter - Costa Rican Coffee
BeerID: 671321
Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: Pours dark brown almost black with diminishing tan lace. Aroma is immediately
  coffee rich and nutty. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the fruity and hazelnut
  vanilla properties of the coffee coming through. Cacao nibs is more in the scent
  than taste for me. Palate is medium to light bodied soft to average carbonation
  but smooth throughout right till the slightly more tannic finish. Very nice.
