| **Comments** | Pours dark brown almost black with diminishing tan lace. Aroma is immediately coffee rich and nutty. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the fruity and hazelnut vanilla properties of the coffee coming through. Cacao nibs is more in the scent than taste for me. Palate is medium to light bodied soft to average carbonation but smooth throughout right till the slightly more tannic finish. Very nice. |
