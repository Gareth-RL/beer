| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body thin tan lace. Dark roasted malt aroma, but not distinctive in the sense of coffee, caramel, or chocolate. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some more definitely chocolate and coffee notes. Medium to light body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I am still wrestling with the English dark ale concept as it seems more a shrug than a definition  |
