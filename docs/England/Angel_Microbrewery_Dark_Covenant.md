Comments: 'Poured dark brown body thin tan lace. Dark roasted malt aroma, but not
  distinctive in the sense of coffee, caramel, or chocolate. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with some more definitely chocolate and coffee notes. Medium to light
  body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I am still wrestling
  with the English dark ale concept as it seems more a shrug than a definition '
