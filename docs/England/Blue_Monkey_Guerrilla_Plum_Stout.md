Comments: Guerilla stout is an excellent example of the style and I see BM add flavours
  with trepidation. But this has enough in the scent to please without eliminating
  everything else. Pours dark brown body with tan lace diminishing.  Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly bitter with definite pluminess but not cloying. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall decent. An
  imperial for the Christmas market perhaps?
