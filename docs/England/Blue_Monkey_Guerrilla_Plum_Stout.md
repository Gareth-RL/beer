| **Comments** | Guerilla stout is an excellent example of the style and I see BM add flavours with trepidation. But this has enough in the scent to please without eliminating everything else. Pours dark brown body with tan lace diminishing.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with definite pluminess but not cloying. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall decent. An imperial for the Christmas market perhaps? |
