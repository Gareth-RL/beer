Comments: Cask at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden with white foam lacing.
  Aroma is pale malts and hop berry. Taste is medium bitter with some sweetness. Palate
  is medium bodied,oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Standard
  but it seems harder than ever to find a bitter that rates higher.
