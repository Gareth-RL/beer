| **Comments** | Aroma has lots of little fruity threads melon, passionfruit maybe random little peeler. None of them robust and some determined to take subtlety to the point of obtuseness. My nose is naive, don't bully it.  Appearance is clarity itself. Think healthy urine sample save for the 2mm of white lace. Taste is medium sweet with the fruit enveloping the bitterness rather than preceding it. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture average carbonation and the finish is bitter but light with fruit still bobbing back. I am tempted to go higher but ultimately it touches some fine qualities but does not grasp them. |
