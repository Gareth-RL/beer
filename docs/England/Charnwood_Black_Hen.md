| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. The aroma has chocolate and coffee notes. Pours mahogany and tan foam top . Tastes medium sweet of stewed plums and  cherry stones with a background bitterness. Medium to full bodied, oily textured with a residual bitter wash on the palate. Better than my first tasting of this with a more languorous finish than before and certainly better than other dark ales on the list this year. |
