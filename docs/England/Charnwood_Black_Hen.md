Beer: Charnwood Black Hen
BeerID: 458631
Brewer: Charnwood Brewery
City: Loughborough
Comments: Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. The aroma has chocolate
  and coffee notes. Pours mahogany and tan foam top . Tastes medium sweet of stewed
  plums and  cherry stones with a background bitterness. Medium to full bodied, oily
  textured with a residual bitter wash on the palate. Better than my first tasting
  of this with a more languorous finish than before and certainly better than other
  dark ales on the list this year.
