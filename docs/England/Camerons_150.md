Beer: Camerons 150
BeerID: 312578
Brewer: Camerons Brewery (UK)
City: Hartlepool
Comments: Cask. Aroma lightly fruity with toasted malt. Red brown body bubbly tan
  top. Not as full or distinct in flavours as one might expect from the colour and
  abv.some caramel and fruit and bread but all as hints and undertones. Very understated
  for a commemorative special. There’s some residual resinous bitter flavour on the
  palate but overall a self-effacing brew.
