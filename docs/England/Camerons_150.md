| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma lightly fruity with toasted malt. Red brown body bubbly tan top. Not as full or distinct in flavours as one might expect from the colour and abv.some caramel and fruit and bread but all as hints and undertones. Very understated for a commemorative special. Thereâ€™s some residual resinous bitter flavour on the palate but overall a self-effacing brew. |
