| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Pours black with a tan lace halo. Aroma richly coffee and chocolate malts vanilla and dark fruits as well. A pudding of a beer. Taste is full to medium sweet with light bitter chocolate notes. Palate is full bodied, creamy texture, flat carbonation, and a long rich finish. A fine specimen but one for the end of the evening or to share with many friends at home. I can&#39;t imagine ever drinking a pint. |
