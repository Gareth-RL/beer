| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma gas some sweet citrus. Pours gold with thin lacing. Tastes more earthy and biscuity than I expected. Reasonably long lasting savour and one can see it as a session pale thanks to the abv. I hope thereâ€™s a market since pales have gone ballistic with the craft revolution. So nice counter from this brewery. |
