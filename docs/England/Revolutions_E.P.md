Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Revolutions E.P
BeerID: 203033
Brewer: Revolutions Brewing (England)
City: Castleford
Comments: Cask. Aroma gas some sweet citrus. Pours gold with thin lacing. Tastes more
  earthy and biscuity than I expected. Reasonably long lasting savour and one can
  see it as a session pale thanks to the abv. I hope there’s a market since pales
  have gone ballistic with the craft revolution. So nice counter from this brewery.
