| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours orange body with lace halo. Aroma has tangerine if that passes for marmalade, with floral notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter which confirms the marmalade quotient. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture but only lightly, otherwise oily, soft to average carbonation, soft light sweet languor. Another beer that I  grew fonder of with each mouthful. |
