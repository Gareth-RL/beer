BeerID: 616765
Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap at The Junkyard. Pours hazy golden with thin white lace. Aroma has lemon
  and grapefruit pith. Taste is similar juicy but bitter and crisp. Palate is medium
  bodied, a bit tongue drying in its acidity, average carbonation, and a bitter astringent
  finish. A summer palate cleanser.
