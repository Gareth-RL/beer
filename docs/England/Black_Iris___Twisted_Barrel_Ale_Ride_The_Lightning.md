| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard. Pours hazy golden with thin white lace. Aroma has lemon and grapefruit pith. Taste is similar juicy but bitter and crisp. Palate is medium bodied, a bit tongue drying in its acidity, average carbonation, and a bitter astringent finish. A summer palate cleanser. |
