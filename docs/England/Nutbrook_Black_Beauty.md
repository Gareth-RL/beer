| **Comments** | Cask pours like black coffee. Smells of licorice and toasted malt. Thin tan head yields surprisingly persistent laces. Taste of cough drops and prunes so I wonder why I liked it. Full bodied with a pleasant languor on the palate. In those early episodes of Coronation Street Ena Sharples could have drunk this &#40;although I seem to recall bottled stout&#41;. Anyway once you have this you may decide that your evening is set. It will stay with you. |
