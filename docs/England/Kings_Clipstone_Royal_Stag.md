Comments: '"Poured dark mahogany body with thin tan lace top. Aroma has nutty earthy
  malts. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sweet which is an interesting reversal.  Palate
  is thin and watery which is unexpected in a stout. Some sticky feel soft to average
  carbonation and a sweet finish. It''s stout Jim, but not as we know it."'
