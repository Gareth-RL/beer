Brewer: Beatnikz Republic Brewing Co.
City: Manchester
Comments: Aroma has confused the cognoscenti (so what chance have I?) I missed the
  strawberry but was induced to smell apricot and peaches so obviously it has to have
  passion fruit and papaya. Lightly hazy golden pale body with white lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet (while you ponder the fruit combination like a pensioner on the
  Vegas machines). It settles to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, some say
  oily others clammy, average to soft carbonation in cask form, and a bitter finish
  with a persistent (some would say nagging) fruit note. Easier to drink than write
  about.
