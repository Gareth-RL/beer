| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham as part of their North Sea Bridges tasting. Pours hazy pale yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma has grassy citrus melon notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a fairly rapid transition. The sweetness has some soft fruit and the bitterness some bread grain. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish.. Easy drinking  |
