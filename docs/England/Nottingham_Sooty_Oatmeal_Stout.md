| **Comments** | Summer isn’t the usual time for a stout but drizzle needs it any day. I’m surprised this isn’t available more often from NB. A champion example of the style.some smoke on the malt for the nose. As dark in the glass as one would wish but don’t expect a Guinness top. Oatmeal stout are thinner headed. There’s a nice spread of flavours on the palate. Biscuit at the back but glossier malt and licorice notes. An old fashioned ale that one can grow old with. |
