Comments: '"Aroma is where it wins. But chilling is probably essential and this was
  a room temperature can. Aroma has the tropical fruits mix that the hops produce.
  Candied pineapple (and papaya) was detected. Looks like a classic NEIPA hazy yellow
  (urine came to mind). Lasting lace halo. Taste is definitely medium sweet sour to
  bitter. All the flavours seem to bunch at the front of the mouth with little registered
  further back. Some acidity. Palate is medium to full body with a growing syrupy
  quality. Average carbonation. Becomes quite cloying (which chilling might offset).
  Bitter finish but less chalky than some. Overall the 8.2% doesn''t deliver a richer
  taste but is not an overriding feature. Again maybe a different taste if from the
  fridge."'
