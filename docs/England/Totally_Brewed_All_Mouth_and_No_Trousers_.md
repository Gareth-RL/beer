Comments: '"Pours in the shadowy end of golden murkiness with white lace. Dank hoppy
  grapefruit and other fruit aromas noted but taste wise it''s the citrus that steals
  the biscuit. But somehow that is the point of these pale soups. Palate is light
  to medium bodied, oily feel if fruit juice is oily, and flat  to soft carbonation.
  Light sour finish. So, if I had never had an NEIPA before I would be appalled. I
  have, so it''s just disappointing."'
