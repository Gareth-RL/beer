Comments: '"Poured pale golden white lace. Fruit and light spice aroma. Lightly bitter
  to sweet with more fruit and a crisp finish that nods to the snow theme. Light to
  medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a crisp bitter spice finish.
  decent. I don''t envy the Beermats employee who shoehorns the ''mat'' into every
  pump clip. I bow to the maestro Mr-Pink-152 on this one."'
