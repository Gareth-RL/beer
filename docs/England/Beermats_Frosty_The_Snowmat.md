Comments: Poured pale golden white lace. Fruit and light spice aroma. Lightly bitter to sweet with more fruit and a crisp finish that nods to the snow theme. Light to medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a crisp bitter spice finish. decent. I don't envy the Beermats employee who shoehorns the 'mat' into every pump clip. I bow to the maestro Mr-Pink-152 on this one.
