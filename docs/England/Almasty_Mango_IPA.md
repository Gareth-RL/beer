| **Comments** | Tap at The Lincolnshire Poacher Nottingham. Pours a murky pale orange with lace top. Aroma was less pungent than expected although mango tropical fruits were there. Also something like toothpaste. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with this wash of acerbic fluid. Odd. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation to create an airy feel and a bitter finish. Not bad but the toothpaste put me off. |
