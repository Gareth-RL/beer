Brewer: Almasty Brewing Co.
City: Shiremoor
Comments: Tap at The Lincolnshire Poacher Nottingham. Pours a murky pale orange with
  lace top. Aroma was less pungent than expected although mango tropical fruits were
  there. Also something like toothpaste. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with
  this wash of acerbic fluid. Odd. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  to create an airy feel and a bitter finish. Not bad but the toothpaste put me off.
