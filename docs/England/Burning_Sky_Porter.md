Brewer: Burning Sky Beer
City: Firle
Comments: Cask at the Canal House. Pours dark with thin tan lacing mostly broken.
  Aroma is coffee and chocolate malts with dark fruit notes. Taste is lightly sweet
  to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, soft to average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. A very solid example of porter for anyone wanting to get the
  difference between porter and stout. Second sipping 30/01/22 still good
