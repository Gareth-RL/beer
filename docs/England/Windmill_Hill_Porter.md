| **Comments** | Nottingham Beer festival 2018. Aroma is richly butterscotch toffee malts. Pours murky muddy brown with bubbly top. Taste is medium sweet and lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a light sour finish. Overall a beer whose aroma raises expectations that are not entirely fulfilled. |
