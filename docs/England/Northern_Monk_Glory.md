| **Comments** | Tap. The Junkyard. I suspect this ale is better from the can. Pours hazy orange gold with thin white lace. Aroma is more mango papaya than pineapple citrus but the nose has fruit that obliterates malts. Taste is surprisingly measured. Lightly bitter to sour. And as others note, no alcohol burn &#40;no reminder or cautionary note&#41;.  Palate is similarly relatively understated medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation but quite a rich almost creamy finish. Is this intended to be a Belgian Tripel or an Imperial? But good which ever way you go. |
