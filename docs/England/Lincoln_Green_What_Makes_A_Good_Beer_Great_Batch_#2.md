| **Comments**  | Poured clear golden body white lace top. Floral hops and pale malts. Medium sweet to lightly bitter some citrus notes and less bitter than batch #1. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A session worthy pale                                                                                      |
