| **Comments** | How should a rice pudding stout taste? Poured dark brown body tan lace --overall a good look. milky and spicy nose. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a souring transition. Thin bodied watery texture average to soft carbonation lightly bitter finish. I will learn to forget it |
