Comments: How should a rice pudding stout taste? Poured dark brown body tan lace --overall
  a good look. milky and spicy nose. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with
  a souring transition. Thin bodied watery texture average to soft carbonation lightly
  bitter finish. I will learn to forget it
