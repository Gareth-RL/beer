| **Comments** | Some smell grapefruit and others peach and I say yeah you are not wrong but neither really penetrate the malt murk that encases them. It's orange, frankly, with just enough lacing to be-well, lacing, I guess. Taste is surprisingly swift to introduce a bitter note, but even this is politely done. Palate is the regimental medium bodied, texture could be smooth but oily on an off day (for the drinker, not the beer: too often the beer suffers for the drinker's flaws), carbonation (having stuck the proverbial finger to the wind) is average, and lo, we have a light bitter finish. And wonder of wonders, it's gluten free. All in all, a miracle but not a star. Cruel, but there we are. 12/07/20 second sipping - still a good beer, although I wish I could tap the blithe spirit of my earlier review |
