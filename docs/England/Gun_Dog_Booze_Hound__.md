Comments: '"Cask. Poured rich brown amber with white lace. Aroma grainy cereal note
  and light hop. Taste is medium sweet with definite malty note.  Palate medium bodied
  clammy feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. It''s an odd bitter and
  an insult to the name which deserved a good beer. I had it alongside Bad to the
  Bone and expected this to be better. Both were nondescript."'
