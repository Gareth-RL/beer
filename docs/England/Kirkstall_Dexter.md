Comments: 'Cask. Pour black with brown tan foam top. Aroma is roasted malts and bitter
  chocolate. Taste is medium sweet and medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied creamy
  feel. Flat carbonation. And a bitter finish. The chocolate is there but the overall
  effect is less than expected. 14/96/22 second sipping. Some lactose in the scent.
  Otherwise the same '
