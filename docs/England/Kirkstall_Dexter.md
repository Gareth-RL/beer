| **Comments** | Cask. Pour black with brown tan foam top. Aroma is roasted malts and bitter chocolate. Taste is medium sweet and medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied creamy feel. Flat carbonation. And a bitter finish. The chocolate is there but the overall effect is less than expected. 14/96/22 second sipping. Some lactose in the scent. Otherwise the same  |
