| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden with thin lacing. Aroma of citrus and yeasty. Softly fruity to the taste with some light biscuit glimmering. A safe blonde session ale. 09/05/2024 second sipping after 8 years and to compare with Red Dog Rose Tattoo. This is better.  More fruit and a bitter grapefruit bite. |
