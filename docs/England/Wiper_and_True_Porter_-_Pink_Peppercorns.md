Brewer: Wiper and True Brewing Co.

Comments: Aroma of dark malts more chocolate cake than coffee and the peppercorn eludes
  my limited olfaction. Pours reddish brown with off-white lacing. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly bitter with just maybe some pepper in the endnote. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light but long bitter finish.  Overall
  I fail to see what the recipe added to the porter base.
