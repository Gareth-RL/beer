| **Comments** | Aroma of dark malts more chocolate cake than coffee and the peppercorn eludes my limited olfaction. Pours reddish brown with off-white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with just maybe some pepper in the endnote. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light but long bitter finish.  Overall I fail to see what the recipe added to the porter base. |
