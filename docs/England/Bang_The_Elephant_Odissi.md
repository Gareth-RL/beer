| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body with thin scummy lace top. Marmalade citrus aroma. Taste is richly sweet in a tangerine kind of way. Palate is medium bodied oily to sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. The Elephant continues to impress. 30/03/24 second sipping. Poured hazy golden white lace top. Aroma citrus pith. Lightly sweet to strong bitter. More grapefruit pith than tangerine this time. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Last time it got 3.6. I like this less 3.3. |
