| **Comments** | Poured golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has grassy light citrus notes atop biscuit malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little sourness in the finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a sour finish. Refreshing but I don't fancy a session of this especially as Great Heck has better. |
