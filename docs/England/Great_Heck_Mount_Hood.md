Comments: '"Poured golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has grassy light citrus notes
  atop biscuit malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little sourness in the
  finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a sour finish.
  Refreshing but I don''t fancy a session of this especially as Great Heck has better."'
