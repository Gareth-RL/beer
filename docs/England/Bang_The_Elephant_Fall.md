| **Comments** | Superb looking ruby bodied bitter with off white lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and hedgerow hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a toasted biscuit malts flavour. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Classic well balanced bitter but the balance leads to blandness  |
