Comments: 'Superb looking ruby bodied bitter with off white lace top. Aroma of roasted
  malts and hedgerow hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a toasted biscuit
  malts flavour. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  Classic well balanced bitter but the balance leads to blandness '
