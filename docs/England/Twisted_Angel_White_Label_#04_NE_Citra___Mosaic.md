Beer: '"Twisted Angel White Label #04 NE Citra / Mosaic"'
BeerID: 628402
Brewer: Twisted Angel Brewing
City: Beverley
Comments: Tap at The beerheadz Nottingham. Hazy amber gold body off white full head.
  Aroma has butterscotch and vanilla notes and pine hops. Taste is medium to full
  bitter after a sweet start. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation,
  and a decidedly crisp bitter finish. So an ale of two halves as it promises sweet
  but ends firmly bitter.
