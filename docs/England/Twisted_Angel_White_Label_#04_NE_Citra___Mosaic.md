| **Comments** | Tap at The beerheadz Nottingham. Hazy amber gold body off white full head. Aroma has butterscotch and vanilla notes and pine hops. Taste is medium to full bitter after a sweet start. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, and a decidedly crisp bitter finish. So an ale of two halves as it promises sweet but ends firmly bitter. |
