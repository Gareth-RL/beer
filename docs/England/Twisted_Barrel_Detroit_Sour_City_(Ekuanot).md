| **Comments** | Tap at the Yarn, new bar space at Nottingham Theatre Royal complex. Aroma is lemon citrus and hay. Pours pale hazy golden body with thin white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a full sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky, average carbonation, astringent, finish. Not sure what Detroit has to do with it... |
