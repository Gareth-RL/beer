Comments: '"Keg at The Canal house Nottingham. Pours red amber with frothy off white
  lacing. Aroma has caramelized malts and fruity hops below. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with a juicy tang. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation
  and a soft fruit finish. I can imagine a session of this although today it&#39;s
  over chilled."'
