| **Comments** | Poured golden body thin lace fading to halo. Aroma of coconut and peach . Medium sweet to bitter with the same tropical combination that I have not noticed before.  Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Interesting.  Mist Rolling Inn has a run of Red Dog. |
