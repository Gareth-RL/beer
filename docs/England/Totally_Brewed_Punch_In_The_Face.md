| **Comments** | Aroma is a muted herbal citrus hops mix. Pours clear golden with white lace top diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Some grapefruit pith and  Catawba grape. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A solid session ale that is subtler than my words convey. |
