| **Comments** | Looks like a stout or porter with its rich dark chestnut body and tan lace top. Smells also richly malted chocolate and toffee malt. Taste is medium sweet with toffee malt evident and a light bitter finish. Palate seems to justify the Mild tag. Thin to medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Intriguing. Another longstanding beer that has evaded me till now. |
