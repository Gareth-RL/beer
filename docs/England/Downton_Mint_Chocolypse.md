| **Comments** | Mint chocolate in the scent. Poured dark reddish brown with tan cream lace. Taste is predictably a sweet bitter car crash since the after dinner mint was not a beer recipe. Palate is watery and thin which is not what I look forward to in a stout. It's not the end of the world but it's ominous. |
