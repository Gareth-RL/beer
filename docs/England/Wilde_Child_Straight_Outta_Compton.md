| **Comments** | Poured slightly hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma has grapefruit and pineapple notes. Taste has medium sweet to bitter with the malts ultimately winning over the hop fruits. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A lot better than the golden ale that preceded it. Better hop mix I guess  |
