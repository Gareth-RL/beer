| **Comments** | Hay, cereal, bread, herbs, and cooked veg detected in the scent. Pours amber gold with a white foam top. Clear with strong lacing. Taste medium sweet, light bitter, with a medium body sticky texture and average carbonation allowing a longish finish. Probably named for the summer pop festival in Nottingham but not sure if itâ€™s just a seasonal ale. 05/07/23 They changed the spelling to English splendour. They should have changed the beer |
