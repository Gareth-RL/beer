Beer: 'Navigation Splendor '
BeerID: 535662
Brewer: Navigation Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Hay, cereal, bread, herbs, and cooked veg detected in the scent. Pours amber
  gold with a white foam top. Clear with strong lacing. Taste medium sweet, light
  bitter, with a medium body sticky texture and average carbonation allowing a longish
  finish. Probably named for the summer pop festival in Nottingham but not sure if
  it’s just a seasonal ale. 05/07/23 They changed the spelling to English splendour.
  They should have changed the beer
