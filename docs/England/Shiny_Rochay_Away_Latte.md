| **Comments** | Espresso brown body tan lace top. Coffee vanilla hazelnut scent. Taste medium sweet to bitter with definite hazelnut syrup kick. Synthetic but okay. Medium bodied coffee grainy texture and a long bitter finish. It's exactly what it claims to be but I could not drink a pint of it. 23 March 23 second sipping still good. |
