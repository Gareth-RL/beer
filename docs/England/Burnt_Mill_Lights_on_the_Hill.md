| **Comments** | Poured a hazy orange gold with ample white foam top. Aroma has strong citrus notes with grapefruit and mango evident above a bed of resinous pine. Taste is lightly sweet with some chalkiness and a rapid souring to bitter tart finish. It's agreeable bitter for an IPA and there is lot of hop subtleties along the way. Palate is medium bodied, quite smooth in the mouth with no more than average carbonation and a dry crisp finish. Certainly this swallow needs a summer as the rain pours outside. I wonder if the Kveik yeast will be passed down the family! |
