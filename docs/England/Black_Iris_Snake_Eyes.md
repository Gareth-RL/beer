| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale yellow with bubbly white top.. Citrus and straw scent. Bitter floral citrus notes but not smooth. Resinous. Overall there are better ales to be had but this is safe enough in an emergency. 5/12/19 second sipping - considering some of the beer supped since , I was harsh. |
