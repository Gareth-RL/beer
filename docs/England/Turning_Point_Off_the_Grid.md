| **Comments** | Aroma of tropical citrus grapefruit mango and tangerine noted.  Pours hazy golden body with thin lace diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with chalky finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. After a promising start it disappointed. |
