| **Comments** | Can. Pours dark brown with tan scummy top and broken lacing. Aroma has coffee roast and milk chocolate sponge. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate medium bodied, creamy viscous feel, lively to average carbonation, and a limpid lightly bitter finish. Good but I bought it expecting more. 09/07/20 purchased in lock down. Poured dark brown but the initial tan foam dissipated quickly. Aroma has the coffee grounds but not the milk chocolate. Taste is medium sweet and there is a chocolate note here. Palate remains medium viscous feel, average to soft carbonation. The current average of 3.51 is closer to how I would rate it now. |
