Comments: '"Something happened to this beer since early expert reviewers spoke of
  amber copper body. It''s now definitely golden pale with a thin lace top and a straw
  sour scent. Taste is medium sweet to sour but with an odd boiled sweet quality.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a souring boiled sweet
  finish. I have made allowances for a dodgy batch but others are drinking it without
  comments, but it is not the beer described in earlier reviews."'
