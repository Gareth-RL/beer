Brewer: Double Top Brewery
City: Worksop
Comments: From the barrel at Central Railway beer festival. Pours black with some
  ruby lights and a tan top. Aroma caramel and toffee malts well roasted with a whisper
  of vanilla. Taste is lightly sweet, slightly spicy, medium bitter and lightly sour
  finish. Palate is medium body, slick feel, flat carbonation, and no great languor.
  But an excellent mild, showing how much flavour can be achieved on a low abv.
