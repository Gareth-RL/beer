| **Comments** | Cask. No great aroma but grassy citrus fruit lurk. Pours honey gold with no head to speak of. The taste might generously be described as Understated. The flavours are muted with lemon and thin biscuit hovering politely like a boy too shy to ask a girl to dance. It coates the palate pleasantly enough but if this is a memorial to Stan, he was lonely. |
