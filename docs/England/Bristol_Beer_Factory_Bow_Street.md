| **Comments** | Some lightly roasted malts in a scent that favours citrus and herbal hops. Pours pale amber with lasting lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the biscuit malts kicking the finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a drying bitter finish. Good enough. |
