| **Comments** | Can at the Crafty Crow. Pours hazy orange gold with off white froth and halo of lacing.Aroma is juicy tropical fruits mango pineapple peach feature for me. Taste is medium to full sweet to medium to light sourness. The bitterness is slow to arrive. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, long finish, while you wait for a crisp bitterness. It does everything it says on the tin &#40;albeit the details are encrypted&#41;. |
