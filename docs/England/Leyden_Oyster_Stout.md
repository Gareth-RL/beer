| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark brown with red tints in the light, bubbly top, but as a tap pour no great head or lace. Aroma dark bitter chocolate culinary strength with licorice and for me, something evocative of the dockside. Predictably malty in the taste with oat bread and yeast competing with caramel and generally winning. Watery rather than fuller on the palate although thereâ€™s a potent bitter afterburner. Good of its type which is all one can ask. But ultimately decide your type and mine is not oyster. |
