| **Comments** | Poured black body with cream lace top. It looks the part. Aroma however is muted. Some roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some sweet malts at the fore and a slow build off bitterness. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. Decent enough  |
