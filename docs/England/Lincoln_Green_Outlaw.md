Comments: 'Poured black body with cream lace top. It looks the part. Aroma however
  is muted. Some roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter some sweet malts at
  the fore and a slow build off bitterness. Medium bodied smooth texture average to
  soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. Decent enough '
