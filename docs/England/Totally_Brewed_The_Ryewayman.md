Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap. Not sure if this will be a special or a new regular red ale. Aroma
  is bread, toast, woody, earthy, with a hint of spice. Pours a very murky brown with
  copper lights and an off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet medium sour with
  the latter building to a sour finish. More sour than bitter in my view. Palate has
  medium body, sticky, average carbonation, long finish. I regard TB as the best of
  a new bunch and I know that some of their special ales become part of the standard
  range. This one looks experimental but tastes good.
