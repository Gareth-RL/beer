Beer: Liverpool Organic Jade
BeerID: 159737
Brewer: Liverpool Organic Brewery
City: Liverpool
Comments: Cask. Pours pale amber with gold lights. Scent of fruits and icing sugar
  The taste has fruit and malt in better balance for a bitter but the hoppy fruits
  predominate and for me at least there was a hint of bubbly gum in the first mouthful
  but thereafter the bitterness grows so the aftertaste is definitely bitter.
