| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma caramel and roasted malts. Pours dark chestnut with tan froth, broken lacing. Tastes bready, with a hint if cough syrup. Medium bodied and soft oily finish. I suspect this is a good example of why youngsters eschew Mild and old farts cherish it. Could do with some more dark fruit but fine enough  |
