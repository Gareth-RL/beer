| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark brown, white top. Aroma grapefruit and melon peel. Taste has fruit and floral notes on solid malt biscuit base. Watery un the mouth but medium bodied overall with some soft malts lingering. A flavoursome pint for the strength and skilled blending of hops. Anyone can make a 5% ale taste good but this dies as well at 4.6%. Recommended  |
