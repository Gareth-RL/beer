| **Comments**  | Bottle. Poured amber body thin lace top mostly diminishing. Light pale malt and citrus hop scent. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter: some fruit initially and a pale malt finish. But not a lot of note! Texture is light to medium bodied. Slightly watery in the finish. Average carbonation and a bitter finish. A session ale which is more harmless than exciting.                                                                                      |
