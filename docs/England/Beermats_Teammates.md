Comments: '"Bottle. Poured amber body thin lace top mostly diminishing. Light pale
  malt and citrus hop scent. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter: some fruit initially
  and a pale malt finish. But not a lot of note! Texture is light to medium bodied.
  Slightly watery in the finish. Average carbonation and a bitter finish. A session
  ale which is more harmless than exciting."'
