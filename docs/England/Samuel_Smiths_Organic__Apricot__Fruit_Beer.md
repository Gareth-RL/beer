| **Comments** | You will either love it or hate it, depending on how sweet you like your apricots. The aroma is apricot jam. Poured golden with white lace top. Taste is full fruited and sweet with just a backnote of bitterness. Palate is clammy sticky jammy but not that heavy. Average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I drink a fruit beer expecting fruit and this has apricot in abundance but not a lot else.  |
