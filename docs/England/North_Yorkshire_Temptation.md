Beer: North Yorkshire Temptation
BeerID: 221017
Brewer: North Yorkshire Brewing Co.
City: Warrenby
Comments: Cask. Pours pale gold with white top. Strong lacing. Aroma richly malt and
  modestly hoppy. Taste reverses scent. Richly fruity atop a modest biscuit malt.
  Medium to light body. Soft finish. But an excellent session bitter at 3.8%. As Oscar
  says the only sure way to end temptation is to yield to it.
