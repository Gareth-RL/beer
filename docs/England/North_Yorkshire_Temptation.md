| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale gold with white top. Strong lacing. Aroma richly malt and modestly hoppy. Taste reverses scent. Richly fruity atop a modest biscuit malt. Medium to light body. Soft finish. But an excellent session bitter at 3.8%. As Oscar says the only sure way to end temptation is to yield to it. |
