Comments: '"Deep chestnut body tan lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts; a hint of treacle
  and dark stone fruit. Taste is medium sweet with more stone fruits in the flavour--date/fig
  to my palate. Bitter finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation,
  and lasting finish. I had not known what to expect although BM''s Gorilla had given
  me some hope. But 9%, I will rarely drink one alone."'
