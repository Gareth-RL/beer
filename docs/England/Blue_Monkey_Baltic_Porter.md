| **Comments** | Deep chestnut body tan lace top.  Aroma of roasted malts; a hint of treacle and dark stone fruit. Taste is medium sweet with more stone fruits in the flavour--date/fig to my palate. Bitter finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and lasting finish. I had not known what to expect although BM's Gorilla had given me some hope. But 9%, I will rarely drink one alone. |
