| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange with white lace top. Aroma has floral citrus hops with tangerine and grapefruit predominant. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite tang. Palate is medium bodied, smooth feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Good stuff for a summer day. It will bring out the heathen in you. |
