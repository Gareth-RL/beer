| **Comments** | Poured black body with tan cream lace diminishing to halo. Aroma has dark malty notes- chocolate coffee whiff of toffee. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with the latter dominant so this is dark chocolate and cacao.. palate is medium to full body, soft carbonation just a hint of graininesslike filter coffee but generally smooth. Finish accentuates the bitter quality overall. I expected more cake. |
