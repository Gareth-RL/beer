| **Comments** | Cask at Joseph Else. Pours very dark coffee with thick cream head. Aroma licorice and caramelized malts. Taste is predictably malty to the fringe of cough syrup but with some biscuit and fruit hop flavours to temper the medicinal. No great languor on the palate just a smooth wash with some carbonation at the end. It looks suitably wintry, and tastes aptly dark, but Santaâ€™s taste is less subtle than mine. 11/12/23 second sipping as it gets another outing at JDW. Still malty in a licorice cough syrup kinda way. |
