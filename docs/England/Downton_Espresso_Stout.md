Brewer: Downton Brewery
City: Salisbury
Comments: Chocolate malt nose. Mahogany body with tan lace top. Taste is coffee grounds
  and dark chocolate so the bitter is more evident than any sweetness. Palate is medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I prefer a sweeter
  stout.
