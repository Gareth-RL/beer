| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate and berry notes. Pours dark brown with ruby light. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture soft to average carbonation and a snack of raspberry in the finish. Odd, frankly. This is a flip side taphouse and yet the beer is unpredictable in quality possibly because of staff turnover. This was very berry compared to chocolate and carbonation was lighter than expected  |
