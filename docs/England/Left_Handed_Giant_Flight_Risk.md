| **Comments** | Aroma has blueberries almond and caramel malts.  Some chocolate too. Pours black with tan cream halo. Taste is medium to full sweet but with some background chocolate bitterness although the fruit returns to add to the sweetness. In short this is a sweet one. Palate is a smooth as you like medium bodied creamy texture almonds, soft to average carbonation, and a beautiful long finish . And a left handed like me and da Vinci. Excellent  |
