| **Comments** | Cask at The Herbert Kilpin. Pours cloudy orange body thin halo. Aroma is relatively muted - pale grainy malts and lightly citric hops. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, bitter finish. A bit of a disappointment as this brewer can do better. |
