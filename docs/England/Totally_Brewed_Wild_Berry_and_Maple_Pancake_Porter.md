| **Comments** | Definitely berry but black rather blueberry with tannin notes, neither maple nor pancake detected. Ruby chestnut body and off white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with artificial fruitiness. Palate is medium to thin bodied, sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish but no matter how long you wait the pancake won't come. Novelty beer. |
