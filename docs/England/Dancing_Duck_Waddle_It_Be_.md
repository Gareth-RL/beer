| **Comments** | Bottle, Pours clear pale golden body with a thin and rapidly diminishing lace top. Aroma has an odd mix of fruity notes and bread malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some orange fruit-gum tang and even a lightly peppered finish. Palate is medium bodied, slightly grainy texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Another beer that I have seen about me for a long time and always assumed that I had reviewed. Decent enough, but again I can't get excited over it. |
