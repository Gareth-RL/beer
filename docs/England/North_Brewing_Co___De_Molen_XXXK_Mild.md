Comments: '"Pours ruby copper body with thin lace top. Rich malty scent. Pungent and
  potent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with roasted malts. Bready but in a rich
  satisfying way and the heat is well managed. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel
  soft to average carbonation and a long finish. An imperial Mild - who''d have thought?"'
