BeerID: 1049131
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.

Comments: Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma has the usual tropical fruit
  mix from Citra and El Dorado hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with melon
  and pineapple battling it out with mandarin and papaya. Medium bodied chalky texture
  average carbonation and a light mineral finish. An easy drinking pale . My only
  complaint is the chalky texture and finish but it seems endemic to these pales
