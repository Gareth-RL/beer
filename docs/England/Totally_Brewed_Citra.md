Brewer: Totally Brewed

Comments: Keg at the Overdraught. Quite a muted hoppy note for a Citra beer with pale
  malt more evident to me. Pours cloudy orange with bubbly lace halo. The taste is
  again more like a bitter with some biscuit malt bitterness rather than a juicy American
  pale. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a crisp finish.
  So disappointing.
