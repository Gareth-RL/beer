| **Comments** | Poured very murky indeed like freshly blended yellow grapefruit although the nose is more pineapple and pear . Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a light mineral chalkiness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. It's certainly refreshing in that unsubtle NEIPA vway. |
