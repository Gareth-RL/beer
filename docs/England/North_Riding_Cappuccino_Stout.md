Beer: North Riding Cappuccino Stout
BeerID: 623822
Brewer: North Riding Brewery
City: Snainton
Comments: Aroma had more berry fruit than I anticipated but the coffee malts came
  through. Poured dark brown body with thin tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to
  bitter with definitely milky coffee notes. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture
  average to soft carbonation bitter finish with just a hint of vanilla. Overall an
  easy drinking stout that appears popular with the cognoscenti of the East Midlands
  (you know who you are).
