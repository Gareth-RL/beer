| **Comments** | Aroma has a mix of pineapple and pine and herbal notes that suggest a real hoppy mix. Classic murky body and thin lace top of an NEIPA. Taste is medium sweet, dissolving into light bitter finish. The last is long and well defined. But I am ambiguous about the mouth feel. Medium bodied, dank fruity texture certainly but the transition is a bit dirty for my taste. But this is me quibbling which in my line of work is almost obligatory. |
