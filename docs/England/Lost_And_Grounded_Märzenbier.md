| **Comments** | Pouring copper body with white lace top. A little malt in the scent but some Marzen deliver more. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with the biscuit flavour building. Medium bodied, mouth coating, with the carbonation leaving a fizz on the tongue. Bitter finish. It's in the style but not the top. |
