| **Comments** | Cask at the Vat and Fiddle. Pours reddish brown with tan lace top. Aroma has stewed cherry and the barest hint of chocolate &#40; I hope your Black Forest gateau was better&#41;. Taste is medium sweet and light to medium bitter. Palate is thin to medium which I guess is easy  drinking stout. Texture is thin carbonation average at best and finish is blah. If you have Peruvian cacao, cherries and radom hops you can do this. |
