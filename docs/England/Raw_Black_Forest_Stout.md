Comments: '"Cask at the Vat and Fiddle. Pours reddish brown with tan lace top. Aroma
  has stewed cherry and the barest hint of chocolate &#40; I hope your Black Forest
  gateau was better&#41;. Taste is medium sweet and light to medium bitter. Palate
  is thin to medium which I guess is easy  drinking stout. Texture is thin carbonation
  average at best and finish is blah. If you have Peruvian cacao, cherries and radom
  hops you can do this."'
