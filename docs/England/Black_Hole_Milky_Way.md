BeerID: 77920
Brewer: Black Hole Brewery
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Cask. Aroma of yeast and malt. Pours golden with white top. Taste has soft
  hop fruits with some acidic citrus notes at the back. Medium bodied with some sugary
  languor on the palate. I drank it in memory of Victoria Wood whose death has just
  been announced. She deserved better but you never know. Drink for today.
