| **Comments** | My bottle gushed on opening so the first glass was entirely foam. However, once that passed it poured pale amber with the said formidable foam. Aroma is berry hops and pale malt for me. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little biscuit in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average + carbonation in the bottled variety, and a bitter finish. I think one can use for this beer what Churchill allegedly said of his successor Clement Attlee: a modest beer with a lot to be modest about. |
