Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Tap at Beerheadz Nottingham . Pours murky orange brown with scummy top briefly.
  Aroma has roasted malts and tropical hops as seems to be a fad. Taste is medium
  sweet to sour and then a growing bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, creamy feel,
  soft to average carbonation, and bitter finish. I am still not convinced that this
  combination is a winner since it still sends my taste buds in incompatible directions.
