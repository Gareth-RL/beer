| **Comments** | Aroma is hard to place - piney but citric herbal and grassy. Not much malt in the scent. Pours rich amber gold with thin lace top. Taste has caramel malts and green tea and citrus hops so it delivers. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish with definitely tea present. Not sure about it as a session beer given its multifaceted character as most sessions sustain a note. But intriguing as a core beer. Second sipping 13/11/19 as part of the Beerhawk Advent calendar [begun as I leave early in Dec]. Any way the flavour is still interesting and blends tea and citrus nicely. still not a session beer for me despite the low abv. Third sipping 22/04/24 still interesting but less so |
