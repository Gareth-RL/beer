Beer: Lincoln Green Indium

Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Cask. Aroma of pineapple and mango. Pours yellow gold with lasting lace
  top. Taste has fruit similarly foregrounded with more citrus and grassy elements.
  Predictably the hop bitterness kicks in gently within a medium bodied languor on
  the palate. A pleasant pint a d one that hits the spot after a long day. I feel
  my muscles unwind.
