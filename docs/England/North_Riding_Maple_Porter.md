Beer: North Riding Maple Porter
BeerID: 987801
Brewer: North Riding Brewery
City: Snainton
Comments: Poured dark chestnut body with tan cream lace top. Aroma of dark malts and
  maple syrup. The syrup rather overwhelmed the caramel malts. It has a bitter finish
  which is a sharp contrast to what came before. Palate is thin to medium bodied mouth
  coating average to soft carbonation and a long bitter finish. Certainly maple infused
  for pancake Day.
