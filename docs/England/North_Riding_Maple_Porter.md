| **Comments** | Poured dark chestnut body with tan cream lace top. Aroma of dark malts and maple syrup. The syrup rather overwhelmed the caramel malts. It has a bitter finish which is a sharp contrast to what came before. Palate is thin to medium bodied mouth coating average to soft carbonation and a long bitter finish. Certainly maple infused for pancake Day. |
