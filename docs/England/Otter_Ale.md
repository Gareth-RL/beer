| **Comments** | Cask at The Company Inn Nottingham. Pours amber chestnut with scummy broken lacing. Aroma has roasted malts and hop fruits. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long bitter finish. It reminds me of the bitter that I had to drink 30 years ago. |
