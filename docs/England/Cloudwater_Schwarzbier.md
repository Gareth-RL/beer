| **Comments** | I am not a lager drinker and my German beer preferences have tended to be Bock. But this is really good. Excellent roasted malt aroma. Pouring dark body full tan lace. Taste is medium to bitter with dark stone fruit and grainy notes. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Impressive. My first 4.0 in the style. |
