Comments: I am not a lager drinker and my German beer preferences have tended to be
  Bock. But this is really good. Excellent roasted malt aroma. Pouring dark body full
  tan lace. Taste is medium to bitter with dark stone fruit and grainy notes. Palate
  is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Impressive.
  My first 4.0 in the style.
