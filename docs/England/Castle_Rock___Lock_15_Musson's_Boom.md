| **Comments** | Collab with Lock 15 Brewing (Ohio?). Peanut butter porter as is obvious from the scent. Poured dark brown thin lace. Medium sweet to lightly bitter and the peanut butter is pretty relentless. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. On keg and cold as ice. That may explain my lack of enthusiasm  |
