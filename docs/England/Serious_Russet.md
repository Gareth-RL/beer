| **Comments** | Cask at Beerheadz Nottingham. Appropriately the aroma has a bit of apple, nut and spicy hop. Pours reddish amber with a pale tan top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to soft carbonation and a sour finish. An interesting brew |
