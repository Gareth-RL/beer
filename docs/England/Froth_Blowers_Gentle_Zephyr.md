Brewer: Froth Blowers Brewing
City: Birmingham, Erdington
Comments: At the Canal House Nottingham. Aroam has apples, pale malt and bread notes.
  Pours golden with white froth but diminishing to halo lacing. Taste is medium bitter
  with light sweetness either side. Palate ismedium body, sticky, average carbonation,
  long finish, Overall despite a second Kolsch this week the style remains a mystery
  to me.
