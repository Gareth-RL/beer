Beer: Beeston Hop Tripel
BeerID: 831331
Brewer: Beeston Hop
City: Sneinton
Comments: Poured a murky amber with sediment and a cream lace top. Aroma has toffee
  malts amid the banana yeasty notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate
  is medium bodied smooth and creamy texture with a dry finish. I am still trying
  to find my way around the Belgian tradition and this style is proving attractive.
