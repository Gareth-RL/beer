Comments: 'Tap. Aroma orange citrus zest. Pours cloudy orange and headless. Tastes
  strongly citrus with lemony notes but there’s a sour bubble in the tail that is
  harder to unpack. I couldn’t but it was exactly what a warm day required. 15/08/19
  second sipping.  The sour bubble that puzzled me last time seems to be a combination
  of lemon and herbs. '
