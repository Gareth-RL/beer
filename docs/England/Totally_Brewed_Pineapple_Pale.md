| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours lightly hazy yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma has to my infinite lack of surprise - pineapple &#40;the bit closer to the rind with more sourness&#41;. Some nose out there will detect lychee, gooseberry or plum, but for these unpretentious nostrils it&#39;s pineapple. Taste is more of a challenge since the medium sweetness is bubble gum like and pineapple bubble gum has yet to be a thing. Hence palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long slightly souring finish. A well named beer that does what it says on the tin. |
