| **Comments**  | Not over-impressed. My 3rd stout at the Crown Beeston ( kudos for having 3). Some coffee malt in a muted aroma. Dark brown body tan lace top Taste is medium sweet to bitter, I suppose. But the sweet is brief and the bitter is accented by the maltings and the hops. Not impressed by the multigrain approach it doesn't produce a better flavour or texture. But it is okay                                                                                       |
