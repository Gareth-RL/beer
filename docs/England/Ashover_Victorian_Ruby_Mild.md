Beer: Ashover Victorian Ruby Mild
BeerID: 420439
Brewer: Ashover Brewery
City: Clay Cross
Comments: Bottle. Poured dark brown with offwhite/tan foam lacing (in abundance despite
  a slow tilted pour). Aroma has dark malts with just a dash of licorice. Taste is
  lightly sweet to bitter with a more pronounced licorice tang. Palate is medium bodied,
  smooth texture, average to full carbonation, and a bitter spiced finish. A useful
  reminder to any youngster who scoffs at Mild. And potent.
