| **Comments** | Settles to a clear golden body with white foam top. Not the most tropical fruit nose of NEIPAs but citrus and pineapple evident. Taste is medium sweet to bitter a hint of peach alongside the citrus. Palate is medium bodied grainy texture and a drying mouth coating finish. Maybe it would taste better on sunny summer day rather than late November but serviceable  |
