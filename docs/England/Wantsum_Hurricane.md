Comments: 'Settles to a clear golden body with white foam top. Not the most tropical
  fruit nose of NEIPAs but citrus and pineapple evident. Taste is medium sweet to
  bitter a hint of peach alongside the citrus. Palate is medium bodied grainy texture
  and a drying mouth coating finish. Maybe it would taste better on sunny summer day
  rather than late November but serviceable '
