Beer: Muirhouse Ruby Jewel
BeerID: 149009
Brewer: Muirhouse Brewery
City: Ilkeston
Comments: Cask. Pours copper with white top. No lace. Aroma muted malts The taste
  is sweet but more bread and biscuit than fruit. It is a pleasant enough bitter but
  could be better balanced with some attention to the hop bitter end of the spectrum.
  There are folks out there who like a bitter to be bitter. Not me, of course. Sweetness
  personified.
