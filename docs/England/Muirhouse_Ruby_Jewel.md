| **Comments** | Cask. Pours copper with white top. No lace. Aroma muted malts The taste is sweet but more bread and biscuit than fruit. It is a pleasant enough bitter but could be better balanced with some attention to the hop bitter end of the spectrum. There are folks out there who like a bitter to be bitter. Not me, of course. Sweetness personified. |
