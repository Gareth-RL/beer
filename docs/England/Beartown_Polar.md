Comments: '"You either like it or you don&#39;t. Cask at the Hand & Heart. Pours dark
  brown almost black with a bubbly tan top. Aroma has coffee malts with maybe a treacle
  note. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter and that is a good transition for
  a stout as many sweeten. Palate is never far from medium bodied, sticky texture
  of a treacly kind, carbonation average,  long finish. And yet the sum is less than
  the parts. The Irish are in no danger."'
