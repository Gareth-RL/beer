| **Comments** | Chocolate malt and berry hops. Poured deep chestnut body with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet medium sweet with surprising fruitiness amidst the chocolate. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. But it packs a lot of flavour. Not a classic porter by any means but eminently drinkable. |
