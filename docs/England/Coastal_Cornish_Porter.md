Beer: Coastal Cornish Porter
BeerID: 254761
Brewer: Coastal Brewery
City: Redruth
Comments: Cask. Roasted malt aroma some coffee edging towards mocha. Pours very dark.
  Tan bubble top. Complex taste ranging from chocolate biscuit to pine nuts. This
  is offset by the lightness on the palate with a lack of body but definite persistence
  of flavours that need some contrast to disentangle them. Too much of a good thing.
