| **Comments** | Cask. Roasted malt aroma some coffee edging towards mocha. Pours very dark. Tan bubble top. Complex taste ranging from chocolate biscuit to pine nuts. This is offset by the lightness on the palate with a lack of body but definite persistence of flavours that need some contrast to disentangle them. Too much of a good thing. |
