| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Amazed that I have no review on file given its ubiquitous presence in local Indian restaurants. And it may well be better in the bottle. Here it had a grassy spruce hop scent. Poured a pale gold with no head to speak of. Was very sweet and fruity but had a lasting bitter finish. The palate was medium bodied crisp texture and average carbonation with a souring finish. Given it was the strongest beer at the festival&#045;&#045;a disappointment. |
