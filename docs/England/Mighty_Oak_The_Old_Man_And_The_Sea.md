| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with thin tan lace. Lightly scented some dark roasted malt evident. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with both chocolate and coffee malt working to enhance the latter. Palate is medium to light bodied, smooth, average carbonation, with maybe a little ash in the finish. Overall, a well-made stout although not as creamy or as rich as some available. |
