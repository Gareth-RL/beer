| **Comments** | Cask. Pours polished copper. Thin top. Aroma toffee malt. Taste of biscuit with hints of plum and fig. Full flavoured but light on the palate - some hops in the end. A very pleasant surprise it should be as regularly available as Hood or Marion. And it&#39;s back at least for Xmas  |
