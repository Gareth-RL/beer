Comments: '"Tap. Aroma the coconut is duly noted. But alongside some dark fruits there&#39;s
  a range of earthy autumnal qualities. Pours a murky brown with a circle of off white
  lacing.. The taste retains the dark fruits and is medium sweet to light sourness.
  Another beer from a brewery that likes complexity. The palate is medium to light
  body, soft carbonation, rich full feel, lingering finish. One to revisit."'
