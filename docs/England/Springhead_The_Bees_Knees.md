| **Comments** | Cask. An occasional ale; if only. Aroma is remote and is not honeyed. But to be fair the appearance is golden honey with a white top. Unfortunately this is its high point. Taste is vaguely and watery sweet. But instead of droning on, may I advise busy bees to give it a miss. The honey was wasted. |
