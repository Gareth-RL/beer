Beer: Springhead The Bees Knees
BeerID: 117348
Brewer: Springhead Brewery
City: Laneham
Comments: Cask. An occasional ale; if only. Aroma is remote and is not honeyed. But
  to be fair the appearance is golden honey with a white top. Unfortunately this is
  its high point. Taste is vaguely and watery sweet. But instead of droning on, may
  I advise busy bees to give it a miss. The honey was wasted.
