Beer: Navigation Viceroy IPA
BeerID: 295049
Brewer: Navigation Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: It’s warm enough for a IPA and this is Navigations. It’s not going to worry
  Castle Rock unduly. A waft of citrus. A honey brown body with thin lace top. A decent
  balance of hop and malt. Fruit and biscuit. But nothing to stir the band to play.
