| **Comments** | Barrel pour at Great Central Railway beer festival. Amber gold body with no lace just a ring of bubbles. Aroma is roasted malts. A light pine or herbal note perhaps but the pale malts are to the fore. Taste is medium bitter and medium sour with a light fleeting sweetness in there .somewhere . Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, flat, long finish. The marquee is swaying in the wind - Lord knows how it will cope with a train passing. |
