| **Comments** | Bottle from Beautiful Beers. Pours dark chestnut with tan lacing. Aroma is cocoa powder and drinking chocolate. Taste is sweet like milk chocolate and while there is a transition to light bitterness, the stout elements are drowned in cocoa rather than enhanced. Surprised it has escaped me thus far. Given the muttering of others about syrup and artificiality, the bottle insists that it's organic chocolate malt and cacao extract. Have it with your dessert. |
