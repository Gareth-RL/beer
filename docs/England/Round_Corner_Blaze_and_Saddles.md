Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 7.0
Beer: Round Corner Blaze and Saddles
BeerID: 840209
Brewer: Round Corner Brewing
City: Melton Mowbray
Comments: Poured an amber gold en clear body with diminishing white lace. Aroma has
  grainy herbal earthy quality with any citrus confined to the background; yeasty.
  Taste is medium sweet to sour with almost a meaty quality to it so unusual. Or maybe
  I am tasting what the brewer refers to as horse-saddle funk. Palate is medium bodied
  with average carbonation, a drying texture and a bitter spice finish.  Intriguing
  and I will try it again.
