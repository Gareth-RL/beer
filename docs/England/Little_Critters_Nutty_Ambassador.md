Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of hazelnut chocolate and vanilla.
  Medium sweet to bitter with chocolate hazelnut vanilla and a dark malt finish. Not
  a lot of space for hops. Medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. A pastry stout indeed '
