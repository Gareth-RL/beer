Comments: This is a highly aromatic and interesting beer. The scent does indeed convey
  the strawberry, vanilla and cocoa of its promise. It pours an unclear dark brown
  body with a tan halo. The taste is less striking in terms of flavours being medium
  sweet to bitter with some strawberry and vanilla fighting in the murk against the
  bitterness. It has a medium body with slight sticky feel and soft carbonation and
  a bitter finish. It ultimately flatters to deceive since the aroma is striking bit
  the taste is less so. And I question whether it is really IPA-like.
