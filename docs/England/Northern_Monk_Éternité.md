| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy golden body scummy lace top. Aroma has floral citrus hops with spicy notes. Taste is medium sweet and sour with a definite yeasty spicy note throughout. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall a very interesting and distinctive farmhouse beer. |
