| **Comments** | Cask. Joseph Cotton Hartington. Pours bronze chestnut body with white lace top. Aroma has roasted malts and berry fruits with a biscuity malt finish. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Quite bitter for a porter but pleasant enough |
