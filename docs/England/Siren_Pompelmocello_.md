| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy orange yellow with white lace. Aroma has funk, pithy grapefruit and pine. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a chalky note. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and sour finish. Overall this pale edges towards the Wild. |
