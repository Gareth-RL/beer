| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden but cleared with a dissipating white foam head. Juicy nose: citrus and especially pink grapefruit. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with mango notes. Palate is medium body crisp feel average carbonation with a dank bitter finish. Very decent example of the style. |
