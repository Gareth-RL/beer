| **Comments** | If you have ever wondered what a beer brewed with raspberry jam donuts would taste like, your question is answered. Smells sweet and jammy. Poured hazy golden body with white lace top. Taste is predictably sweet but this settles as the donuts give way a little to the pale malts. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture and a light fruit finish. A novelty beer but there are worse every Christmas. |
