| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway Beer Festival 2018. The aroma has caramel malts and some licorice notes. It pours a cola coffee colour with no real head. The taste is medium sweet to light bitter. The palate is more thin than medium although the sticky texture compensates a little for the flat to soft carbonation. It has a bitter finish. I like a nice sweet stout so this was a disappointment but it may well be that it tastes better when not poured from the cask on a windy railway platform&#033; |
