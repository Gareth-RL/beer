Comments: '"Tried at the Great Central Railway Beer Festival 2018. The aroma has caramel
  malts and some licorice notes. It pours a cola coffee colour with no real head.
  The taste is medium sweet to light bitter. The palate is more thin than medium although
  the sticky texture compensates a little for the flat to soft carbonation. It has
  a bitter finish. I like a nice sweet stout so this was a disappointment but it may
  well be that it tastes better when not poured from the cask on a windy railway platform&#033;"'
