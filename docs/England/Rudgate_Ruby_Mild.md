| **Comments** | Its reputation goes before. Excellent colour with nice shading. Nuts in the scent. Malt on the tongue. A pleasing sweetness. And at a strength where one can have a second glass. Accolades deserved. 4/05/23 second sipping as my Mild trail continues. Pleasant enough 10/05/23 second sipping on the Trail |
