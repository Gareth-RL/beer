| **Comments** | Cask. Some roasted malt, bread and biscuit on the nose. Pours dark with ruby notes. Taste has a resinous edge not smooth. Taste would be diplomatically as balanced but less kindly as bland. Medium to light body and a slight languor of malt that could be mistaken for weak Bovril.  |
