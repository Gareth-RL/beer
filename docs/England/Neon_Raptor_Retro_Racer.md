| **Comments** | Aroma has light citric notes. Poured pale murky orange juice looking with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is light to medium bodied, sticky feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish with some background mineral qualities. For me, this session of three thirds has been instructive. The higher abv hop mix has not delivered the taste I enjoyed in the lower abv DDH beer. |
