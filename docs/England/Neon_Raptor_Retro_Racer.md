Beer: Neon Raptor Retro Racer
BeerID: 811167
Brewer: Neon Raptor Brewing Co.
City: Nottingham
Comments: Aroma has light citric notes. Poured pale murky orange juice looking with
  thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is light to medium bodied,
  sticky feel soft carbonation and a light bitter finish with some background mineral
  qualities. For me, this session of three thirds has been instructive. The higher
  abv hop mix has not delivered the taste I enjoyed in the lower abv DDH beer.
