Beer: Wiper and True / Van Moll Crescendo
BeerID: 547415
Brewer: Wiper and True Brewing Co.

Comments: Tap. Pours cloudy hazy yellow body and bubbly white thin top. Aroma has
  lots of citrus - grapefruit pith and tangerines. Taste light sweet and light to
  medium sour. Oily texture. Flat carbonation and a lingering sour finish. Not the
  most complex DIPA but eminently drinkable.
