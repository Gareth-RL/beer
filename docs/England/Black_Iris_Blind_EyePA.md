| **Comments** | Poured hazy pale yellow with a lot of froth at least 1/3rd of a pint glass. Aroma of lemon pineapple and melon. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruitiness, some creaminess, and a light malt finish. Light to medium bodied, smooth texture, over carbonated, and a light bitter finish, apart from the fizz. For someone Nottingham based, I want to try more Black Iris but in the can they have a tendency to over-carbonate and that is frustrating in a way that cannot be put down to my liking for a pint glass and a tilted pour. |
