Comments: Poured dark brown body tan lace. Aroma of roasted malts and dark fruits.
  Medium sweet with light caramel and the burnt bitter finish. Medium bodied, over
  carbonated or is that the live yeast effect. bitter finish. I have grown wary of
  live yeast in cans, but this one opened okay, and the only negative was the way
  the carbonation interfered with both the texture and the finish. Otherwise a better
  than average porter.
