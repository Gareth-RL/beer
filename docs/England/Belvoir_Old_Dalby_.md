Comments: 'Bottle. pours chestnut ruby body with thin fading off-white lacing. Aroma
  has roasted malts and berry fruits from the hops. Taste is light to medium sweet
  but rapidly the hops take over and we have a medium bitterness with a sour mash
  finish. Texture is light to medium bodied, oily, soft to average carbonation, and
  a definite bitter/sour finish considering the malt dominance in the initial scent
  and taste. Thus, it looks like a porter but tastes like an ESB. Interesting to see
  how far the beer has circulated with a very definite Scandinavian sipping early
  on and a decidedly lukewarm reception in Poland. I am sure it would taste better
  in front of a real fire in Old Dalby itself. But decent enough '
