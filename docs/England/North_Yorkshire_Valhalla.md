Comments: '"It''s a beer that gets put in different categories. strong ale on untapped.
  Premium bitter on ratebeer. And Brown ale in this pub. The aroma has a lot going
  on beyond maltloaf; there''s a hint of wet dog. It pours mahogany body with tan
  lace. Medium sweet and definitely malty with a bitter finish. Fortunately the dog
  has stayed outside. Palate is medium to light bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a grainy finish. Whatever it is, it''s more drinkable than the Scandinavians
  believe. 2nd sipping 20/01/22 still decent. Same venue Crafty crow"'
