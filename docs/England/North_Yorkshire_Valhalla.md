| **Comments** | It's a beer that gets put in different categories. strong ale on untapped. Premium bitter on ratebeer. And Brown ale in this pub. The aroma has a lot going on beyond maltloaf; there's a hint of wet dog. It pours mahogany body with tan lace. Medium sweet and definitely malty with a bitter finish. Fortunately the dog has stayed outside. Palate is medium to light bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a grainy finish. Whatever it is, it's more drinkable than the Scandinavians believe. 2nd sipping 20/01/22 still decent. Same venue Crafty crow |
