| **Comments** | Cask. Enough cocoa in the aroma to justify the name. This guerrilla comes out swinging. Pours dark with ruby notes and thin tan head. Tastes more like Frys Turkish Delight than it does of Belgian truffles. So some might find the sweetness too much. But a SIBA gold medal suggests that some discerning palates disagree. As a specialty beer impressive although in being so it buries some stout qualities. 7/11/23 not tried since 2016, but my earlier review stands. |
