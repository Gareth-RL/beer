Beer: Beavertown Smog Rocket
BeerID: 173662
Brewer: Beavertown Brewery (Heineken)
City: Tottenham Hale
Comments: Keg. Aroma has caramel, roasty, coffee, nuts, bread, in no particular order.
  Pours black with tan top and broken lacing. Unable to detect clarity so lets assume
  smog. Taste is medium bitter with a sweet and oily finish. I’m not sure the industrial
  masses had anything as good as this. Hence Methodism.
