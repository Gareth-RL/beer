| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma chocolate roasted malts with earthy undertones. Dark black with ruby hints in the light. Bubbly froth but little lacing. Tastes of coffee licorice and dark fruits. A light stout with a slightly resinous aftertaste. So a beer whose opening flavours are more pleasing than its finish. But oatmeal stout is a tricky type to do really well. |
