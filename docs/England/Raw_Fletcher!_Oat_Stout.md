Beer: Raw Fletcher! Oat Stout
BeerID: 162803
Brewer: Silver Brewhouse (prev Raw) [Industrial Ales] [Funky Hop Donkey]
City: Chesterfield
Comments: Cask. Aroma chocolate roasted malts with earthy undertones. Dark black with
  ruby hints in the light. Bubbly froth but little lacing. Tastes of coffee licorice
  and dark fruits. A light stout with a slightly resinous aftertaste. So a beer whose
  opening flavours are more pleasing than its finish. But oatmeal stout is a tricky
  type to do really well.
