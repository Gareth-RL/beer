Comments: 'Pours black cola body with virtually no lacing. Aroma is dominated by licorice
  malt with some chocolate notes but no oreo cookie!  Taste is predictably sweet with
  a sour licorice finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation,
  Bitter finish. Overall, the Voodoo Stout is better without oreo cookies. '
