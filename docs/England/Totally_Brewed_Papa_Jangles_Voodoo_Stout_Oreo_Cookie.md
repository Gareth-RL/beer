| **Comments** | Pours black cola body with virtually no lacing. Aroma is dominated by licorice malt with some chocolate notes but no oreo cookie!  Taste is predictably sweet with a sour licorice finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, Bitter finish. Overall, the Voodoo Stout is better without oreo cookies.  |
