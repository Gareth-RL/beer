Comments: '"Coffee stout with definite expresso on the nose. Pours dark brown body
  with thin tan lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but emphatically coffee
  flavoured. Palate is medium bodied at most not a lot of cling, soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. It''s a coffee stout that is more coffee than stout "'
