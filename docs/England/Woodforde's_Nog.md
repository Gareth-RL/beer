| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma certainly hints at flat cola and dark fruit, as others note. Tan head, dark brown body. Bready malts predominate at first with some sweet notes and soft carbonation. The bitterness is subdued and fleeting. But as a drinker who favours the dark side the tip towards malt is fine and gives me more toffee to chew on. Nevertheless the chewiness may preclude a second. 01/03/24 six and a half years seems a decent interval. Second sipping reveals a hint of licorice in the malt and a deeper darker flavour overall @ navigation  |
