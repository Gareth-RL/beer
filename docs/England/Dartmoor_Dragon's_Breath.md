| **Comments** | Poured ruby chestnut body thin white lace. Dark malt scent. I'm not sure it's treacle, but toffee certainly. Medium sweet to bitter with more toffee and dark fruits and a hint of licorice in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  A winter warmer in August.  |
