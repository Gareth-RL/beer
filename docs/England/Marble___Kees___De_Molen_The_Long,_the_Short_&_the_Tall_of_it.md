Beer: Marble / Kees / De Molen The Long, the Short & the Tall of it
BeerID: 572867
Brewer: Marble Beers
City: Salford
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours dark mahogany brown halo of tan
  lace. Aroma is treacly, dark fruit, caramel and alcohol with a smoky note but not
  preponderant. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but with enough alcohol burn
  to distract most, I suspect. Palate is full to medium, texture creamy, carbonation
  average to soft, and the finish is long and smoked. A bit rough around the edges
  but the long and the short of it is that this is a potent brew with smoke in the
  tail.
