| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours dark mahogany brown halo of tan lace. Aroma is treacly, dark fruit, caramel and alcohol with a smoky note but not preponderant. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but with enough alcohol burn to distract most, I suspect. Palate is full to medium, texture creamy, carbonation average to soft, and the finish is long and smoked. A bit rough around the edges but the long and the short of it is that this is a potent brew with smoke in the tail. |
