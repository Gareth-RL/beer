| **Comments** | Poured murky orange with off white lace top. Fully fruity hops tropical salad pineapple and grapefruit evident. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit still as dominant and dank as many a Neipa. Palate pulpy soft to average carbonation and a slight mineral finish. Tasty but not English pale. |
