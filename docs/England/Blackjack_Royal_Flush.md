| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma slight. Grassy and mildly malted. Pours a pale amber with white foam top. Taste has biscuity malts and floral hops. To some this is balanced and to others dull. But it makes for an easy drinking bitter that conceals its abv. I’d have it again but wouldn’t seek it out. |
