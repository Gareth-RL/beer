Beer: Blackjack Royal Flush
BeerID: 187784
Brewer: Blackjack Beers
City: Manchester
Comments: Cask. Aroma slight. Grassy and mildly malted. Pours a pale amber with white
  foam top. Taste has biscuity malts and floral hops. To some this is balanced and
  to others dull. But it makes for an easy drinking bitter that conceals its abv.
  I’d have it again but wouldn’t seek it out.
