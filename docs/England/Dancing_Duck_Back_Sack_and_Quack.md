| **Comments** | Cask. The most exciting thing about this is the name. Aroma muted malts. Pours dark with ruby lights. Tastes caramelized malts and fruity hops. Classed as a smooth mild which makes me wonder about the rough ones. But palatable with a pleasant viscous quality. Iâ€™d drink it again. |
