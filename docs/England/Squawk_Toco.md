Brewer: Squawk Brewing Co.
City: Ardwick
Comments: Aroma of melon and grapefruit among other fruits. Poured a decidedly murky
  pale golden body with scummy lace. Taste redeemed. A nice blend of pithy grapefruit
  and mandarin with a smooth transition to a bitter lightly chalked finish. Palate
  light to medium bodied smooth enough average carbonation and a bitter finish with
  the mineral hint but not enough to drop it a point. Easy drinking
