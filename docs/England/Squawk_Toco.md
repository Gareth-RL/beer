| **Comments** | Aroma of melon and grapefruit among other fruits. Poured a decidedly murky pale golden body with scummy lace. Taste redeemed. A nice blend of pithy grapefruit and mandarin with a smooth transition to a bitter lightly chalked finish. Palate light to medium bodied smooth enough average carbonation and a bitter finish with the mineral hint but not enough to drop it a point. Easy drinking |
