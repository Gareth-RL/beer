| **Comments** | Cask. Lightly scented with floral notes. Pours golden with loose white head that laces. My second bland beer in a row. There are hop fruits in the tail of this and some resinous texture on the tongue but overall disappointing. 12/05/24 second sipping 8 years later and grade inflation takes it over the 2 9 |
