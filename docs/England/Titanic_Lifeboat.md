| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma fruitcake with dark fruit, molasses and bread evident. Pours dark brown with thin top. Taste has malty caramels to the fore with a general sweetness that may not suit every bitter drinker but is fine by me. Who knows how far the Titanic can go with less ice and more lifeboats? |
