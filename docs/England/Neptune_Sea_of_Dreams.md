Comments: Poured cloudy pale golden body white foam top.  Aroma of melon and mandarin.  Medium
  sweet to bitter with more citrus and melon.  Medium bodied soapy feel soft to average
  carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Disappointing compared to the other pales
  I have had today. A bad day for new darks.
