| **Comments** | Cask at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours clear golden brown with white lace top. Aroma is herbal grassy hops. Taste is medium bitter to sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a sour finish with a hint of biscuit malt. Not sure if this really tastes like an APA. |
