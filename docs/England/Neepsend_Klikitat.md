Comments: Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden yellow with white
  foam lace top. Aroma citric hops with floral notes. Taste is medium sweet with light
  bitterness. Palate is light to medium body, oily feel, soft carbonation, and a rather
  insipid finish. Some beers grow on you, others, like this one, grow away.
