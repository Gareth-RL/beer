| **Comments** | Tap at Junkyard. Pours unclear golden body and white foam lace top. Aroma is tropical fruit as the hop combination indicates peach papaya melon tangerine pineapple. For all that the taste is lightly sweet with a pale malty granularity that balances well. So the pale malts are respected amidst the hop profusion. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a modest bitter finish. Worthy rather than outstanding. Much like this reviewer. |
