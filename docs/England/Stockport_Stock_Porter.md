Comments: '"Cask. Aroma malts with mil bubble gum and licorice ntes. Pours dark chestnut
  with tan cream too and lace curtaining. Some hops fruits atop the biscuity bread
  of the toasted malts. Creamy so fuller bodied than many porters these days. Having
  tasted a dozen or more this month due to the Stout and Porter Stroll I reckon this
  is one of the better standard porters &#40;others have plum, chocolate or heavy
  smoke."'
