Comments: '"Does what it sets out to do - a light gooseberry sour. Light gooseberry
  and lactose scent.  Golden body with lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to sour but
  softly done. Palate is medium bodied, the lactose clings in the mouth despite the
  average carbonation, and there''s a souring finish. For a first attempt (unlikely!!)
  very good."'
