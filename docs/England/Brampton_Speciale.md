| **Comments** | Aroma split the judges. One was happy with floral fruity notes. Two found soap and another sour. Poured golden body with white lace top. A sweet juicy fruity taste with bitter finish, smooth transition to a crisp finish. Palate is medium bodied velvety texture average carbonation and quite a dry finish. Overall tasty but with some flaws. |
