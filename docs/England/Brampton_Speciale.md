Comments: Aroma split the judges. One was happy with floral fruity notes. Two found
  soap and another sour. Poured golden body with white lace top. A sweet juicy fruity
  taste with bitter finish, smooth transition to a crisp finish. Palate is medium
  bodied velvety texture average carbonation and quite a dry finish. Overall tasty
  but with some flaws.
