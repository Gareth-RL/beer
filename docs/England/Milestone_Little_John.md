| **Comments** | Cask. Stewed plums, malt biscuit. Pours chestnut brown with ruby tints and tan cream top with strong lacing. Taste of roasted hops, biscuity and with hints of cough drops. Medium bodied. The bitter languor on the palate is not a plus for me but itâ€™s an interesting mixture. Tastes like a way station to a better different beer. 10/31/23 another one coming round 6 years later.  Less fruit and less bitter but still unimpressed. 23/03/2024 JDW festival and I failed to check. Thought I had it ages ago. Less likely to make the same mistake but it got me out of the sleet  |
