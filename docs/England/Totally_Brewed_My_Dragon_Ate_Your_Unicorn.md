| **Comments** | An odd beast. Even without the diet described. Aroma has obscure tropical fruit scents guava papaya dragonfruit maybe. Murky orange bodied with diminishing lace halo. Lactose sourness melds with sour fruit on the tongue. Defter brains can determine which is unicorn or dragon. The current keg version is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation ( no fizzy quality really) and a long light sour fruit finish. Refreshing summer sipping and I forgive the cryptic title which led me to query where on the royal coat of arms are the two beasts. A learned paper on the Unicorn as a symbol of Brexit awaits |
