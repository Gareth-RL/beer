| **Comments** | Light malty cereal nose with hoppy backnote. Pours amber copper body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to smoothly growing bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. A refreshing session bitter that delivers more than its abv. |
