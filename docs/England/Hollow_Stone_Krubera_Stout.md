| **Comments** | Pours dark coffee body with full tan cream top. Aroma has berries atop dark coffee malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter--some coffee and blueberries. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish with a little chalkiness which disappointed. Nevertheless, it's a better than average stout. Second sipping 07/10/24 new pump clip. Still good. |
