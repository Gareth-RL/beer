| **Comments** | Cask at the Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours a reddish chestnut brown body with thin white lace top. Aroma has berry hops and roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter with a pleasant fruity patina. The palate is medium bodied, oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it has my respect as a solid example of ruby ale but it still lacks something in terms of body and range of flavour  |
