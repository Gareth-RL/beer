| **Comments** | Cask. Intriguing aroma that modulates from smoked wood and toast to begin and then reveals coffee and chocolate malts. Impressive. Pours very dark brown with tan cream top and ruby notes. Taste is creamier than I was anticipating with caramel and coffee to the fore and thus sweet but the finish is more blended. It stays on the palate and could cloy but overall a fine mild and for my money the best of the Muirhouse range currently.  |
