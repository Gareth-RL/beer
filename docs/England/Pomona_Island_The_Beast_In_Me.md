Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma boozy dark malt and ginger.
  Medium sweet to bitter with treacle backbone and ginger flourish but still more
  alcohol than necessary. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish with a little burn. Rough or is that beastly around the edges '
