Beer: North Brewing Co / Edge Brewing Micro IPA
BeerID: 662772
Brewer: North Brewing Co (England)
City: Leeds
Comments: Tap at The junkyard Nottingham. Aroma has faint peach and pineapple notes.
  Pours cloudy orange with off white lace. Taste is medium bitter with a strong grainy
  quality. Palate is medium bodied as a result, oily texture soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. It punches above its weight and , this kind of low abv product
  may be the next big thing.
