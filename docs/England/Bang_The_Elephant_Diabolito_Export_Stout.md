| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate vanilla and fruitcake. Pours black with thin tan lace mostly diminishing. Taste is richly chocolate fruitcake and vanilla so emphatically sweet stout.  Palate is thin to medium bodied oily texture and a long finish. Only weakness is body and maybe lacing. But the elephant strikes again. |
