| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma roasted malts, coffee and smoky notes. Pours black with cream tan head. Great taste with caramelized malts and some chocolate at the front and a smoked bitterness at the tail. The last few stouts Iâ€™ve encountered have been disappointing in terms of weight on the palate but this one is happily medium to full with a pleasant languor. Excellent  |
