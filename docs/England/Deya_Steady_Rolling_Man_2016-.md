Comments: '"Tap at Junkyard. Pours hazy yellow /orange gold  with thin white lacing.
  Aroma is fruity  - grapefruit, lemon zest, mango and a background of pine. Taste
  is medium sweet to light nothings which puzzled me initially as I waited for a bitter
  or sour transition but like a failed trapeze artist it fell away before it reached
  the outstretched hands. Palate is medium bodied, and not just sticky but fluffy
  like a mouthful of fruity clouds. But then again there''s worse things like the
  DIPA I drank before this. Second sipping. Less poetical than the first. Still slips
  down easy."'
