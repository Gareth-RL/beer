| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John. My raisin, sultanas and candied peel &#40;promised in the brewers de&#083;cription&#41; never smelt like this. Copper body with thin lace top. Taste roasted malts but with a hoppy bitterness always present. A strong beer clearly, but for me winter ales are full of dates, plums, licorice and toffee notes. Here the hops are always there. So not everybody’s Christmas.God bless us everyone&#033; |
