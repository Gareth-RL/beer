Comments: '"There''s a battle or a blend in the scent roasted malts and citrus hops.
  Pours dark body and off white to tan top. Taste is equally contentious medium in
  both sweet and bitter directions. Palate is medium to thin bodied average carbonation
  watery feel and a bitter earthy finish. An experiment, methinks."'
