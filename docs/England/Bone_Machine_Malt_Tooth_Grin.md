Beer: Bone Machine Malt Tooth Grin
BeerID: 603971
Brewer: Bone Machine Brew Co
City: Hull
Comments: Cask. Pours murky brown red with bubbly lace top. Aroma certainly allows
  the Centennial fruits to come through. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter.
  Slightly thin bodied but sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a fading bitter finish.
  A strong ruby mild rather than a formidable one.
