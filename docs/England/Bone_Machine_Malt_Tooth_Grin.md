| **Comments** | Cask. Pours murky brown red with bubbly lace top. Aroma certainly allows the Centennial fruits to come through. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Slightly thin bodied but sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a fading bitter finish. A strong ruby mild rather than a formidable one. |
