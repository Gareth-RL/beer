Beer: Thornbridge Valravn
BeerID: 267376
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Bottle. Aroma has citrus, herbs, grass, hay, nuts. I think I detected some
  caramelized malts amid lemongrass and citric hops. Pours a pleasing chestnut with
  ruby lights and a foamy off-white top. Carbonation average to heavy and that affects
  taste for me causing some qualities to be lost in the billows so to speak. Still
  the initial sweetness is brief and the languor is mainly bitter. Th taste is smooth
  with some creamy notes. Overall it confirmed my favorable rating of Thornbridge
  imperials. Shame you see so limited a range of their beer on draught.
