| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma has citrus, herbs, grass, hay, nuts. I think I detected some caramelized malts amid lemongrass and citric hops. Pours a pleasing chestnut with ruby lights and a foamy off-white top. Carbonation average to heavy and that affects taste for me causing some qualities to be lost in the billows so to speak. Still the initial sweetness is brief and the languor is mainly bitter. Th taste is smooth with some creamy notes. Overall it confirmed my favorable rating of Thornbridge imperials. Shame you see so limited a range of their beer on draught. |
