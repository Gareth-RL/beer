| **Comments** | Cask. The promised array of hoppy scents are in the aroma - floral and citus, tangerine and grapefruit, pine and grass. More copper than gold in colour and long fine lacing. Unsurprisingly the sweeter citrus notes are fore grounded in the taste with bitter edges on the palate. Overall light and refreshing. |
