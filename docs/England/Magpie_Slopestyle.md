| **Comments** | Tap at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours clear golden body white lace top. Aroma has a little citrus but the grapefruit is more evident in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to bitter so not too much grapefruit pith. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish where I would concede the grapefruit is most evident. |
