Beer: Magpie Slopestyle
BeerID: 621912
Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours clear golden body white lace top.
  Aroma has a little citrus but the grapefruit is more evident in the mouth. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter so not too much grapefruit pith. Palate is medium bodied,
  oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish where I would concede the grapefruit
  is most evident.
