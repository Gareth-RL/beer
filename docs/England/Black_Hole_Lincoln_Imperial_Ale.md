| **Comments** | Not an easy task. Once another brewers staple now under contract as a franchise brand. The 'imperial ' tag doesn't do it a favour as a standard bitter. It's also got paler.  Pours golden thin lace top.  Light fruit nose. Medium sweet to bitter with fruit dominant and angled more towards citrus than berry which puzzles but is the way of the world. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Hard to judge but not a winner. At Mist Rolling Inn successor to the Scribblers venue and struggling at the moment.  |
