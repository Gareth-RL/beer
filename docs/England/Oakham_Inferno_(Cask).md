| **Comments** | Cask at the Falcon. Pours pale gold with thin top. Floral scents of citrus. Tastes of pine woods and grasses. A resinous palate with some light hints of biscuit. On a cold winters night with a fire opposite itâ€™s almost nostalgic of summers gone. Good but it will never persuade me to switch allegiance from the darker brews. Put less diplomatically an American ale imperfectly reconstructed 9/11/23 tried first in 2015. Still underwhelmed but not embankment pub  |
