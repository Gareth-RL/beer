Comments: 'Cask at the Falcon. Pours pale gold with thin top. Floral scents of citrus.
  Tastes of pine woods and grasses. A resinous palate with some light hints of biscuit.
  On a cold winters night with a fire opposite it’s almost nostalgic of summers gone.
  Good but it will never persuade me to switch allegiance from the darker brews. Put
  less diplomatically an American ale imperfectly reconstructed 9/11/23 tried first
  in 2015. Still underwhelmed but not embankment pub '
