BeerID: 296562
Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Cask. Aroma of grapefruit and pineapples. Pours pale gold with white top.
  Taste has fruit to the fore but a nice bitter edge below. This makes for a refreshing
  pint with just enough citrus flush lingering to build in the next mouthful. I suspect
  Shiny will go on to great things.
