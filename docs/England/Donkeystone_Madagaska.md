| **Comments** | Poured cola black body with rapidly disappearing lacing. As others note, it's gassy to pour but flat to drink! Not a lot of scent to be savoured either --just a little light coffee malts; the vanilla comes through on the end of the taste, but it's got that artificial flavour to it. Thin, especially for a stout, watery feel, still got high carbonation at the back however, and a curiously dusty finish. I know this was a cheap Lidl can, but eek, what a disappointment. |
