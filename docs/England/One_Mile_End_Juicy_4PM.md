| **Comments** | The aroma has mango pineapple and associated fruits and that includes lychees. Pours cloudy orange golden with white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with just the hint of toothpaste. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a fruit finish with something else that I associate with that moment when you sip your morning fruit juice and it collides with toothpaste. |
