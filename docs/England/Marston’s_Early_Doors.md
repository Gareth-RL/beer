Brewer: '"Marston&#39;s (Carlsberg Marston&#39;s Brewing Co.)"'
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: Cask at the Company Inn. Aroma has citrus, floral, hops , the malts hang
  back. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a muddy quality that I dislike in an
  IPA. Palate medium bodied soft spicy aspect distracts from the feel. Not what I
  look for in an IPA.
