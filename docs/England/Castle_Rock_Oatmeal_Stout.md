Beer: Castle Rock Oatmeal Stout
BeerID: 963354
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Poured black body tan cream top. Nice aroma of creamy coffe and hint of
  caramel. Taste lightly sweet with rapid transit to medium bitter the coffee is stronger
  in the mouth while the caramel disappeared. Medium bodied at most, smooth texture
  soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish with some languor. For me, a good
  example of the style.
