| **Comments** | Poured black body tan cream top. Nice aroma of creamy coffe and hint of caramel. Taste lightly sweet with rapid transit to medium bitter the coffee is stronger in the mouth while the caramel disappeared. Medium bodied at most, smooth texture soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish with some languor. For me, a good example of the style. |
