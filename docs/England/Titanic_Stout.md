| **Comments** | Tap. Earthy roasted malt aroma. Classic black with cram top. Served from the craft corner so in my view over-chilled. This may explain why the flavours were more muted. Bready rather than biscuity with the barley outweighing the hops on the first taste. Some Smokey undertones and one can detect where the vanilla stout hails from. While more to my taste than most Guinness served this may keep me in the mild porter camp. 2nd sipping 5)03/23 still served chilled like a Guinness so all the above applies. |
