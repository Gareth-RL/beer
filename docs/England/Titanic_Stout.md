Comments: Tap. Earthy roasted malt aroma. Classic black with cram top. Served from
  the craft corner so in my view over-chilled. This may explain why the flavours were
  more muted. Bready rather than biscuity with the barley outweighing the hops on
  the first taste. Some Smokey undertones and one can detect where the vanilla stout
  hails from. While more to my taste than most Guinness served this may keep me in
  the mild porter camp. 2nd sipping 5)03/23 still served chilled like a Guinness so
  all the above applies.
