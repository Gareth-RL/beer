| **Comments** | Can. Pours dark brown almost black with a tan halo but little head. Aroma is   dark roasted malts with a hint of smoke and coffee. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with slightly ashy finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Admittedly remote farmhouses, and a sense of foreboding may have added to the enjoyment but they are not always guaranteed. This is a solid stout on the nether end of imperial heading towards porter. But it went down well.  |
