Comments: Poured clear golden body white lace top. Modest aroma of hop and pale malt. Lightly sweet to bitter with not a lot to mention. There are trace elements but boy, bland at best. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Nondescript is too full a description. At the Navigation Inn, which is hard to find on here
