Comments: '"Cask. Aroma richly malty with hints of liquorice and toffee. Pours chestnut
  with cream tan top. Some hop berry fruit in the taste, but the roaste malts ensure
  a steady smooth taste through and through. Given that this beer series is of local
  Nottingham celebs it’s surprising that Lawrence wasn’t first but as a world city
  of literature Nottingham has reason to celebrate. &#40;even if DH himself scarpered
  early on and rarely came back "'
