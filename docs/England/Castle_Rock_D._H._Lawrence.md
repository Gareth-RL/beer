| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma richly malty with hints of liquorice and toffee. Pours chestnut with cream tan top. Some hop berry fruit in the taste, but the roaste malts ensure a steady smooth taste through and through. Given that this beer series is of local Nottingham celebs it’s surprising that Lawrence wasn’t first but as a world city of literature Nottingham has reason to celebrate. &#40;even if DH himself scarpered early on and rarely came back  |
