| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden body with full foam white lace top. Lemon and tangerine citrus in the aroma. Taste is medium sweet with juice element prominent and then transition to a light sour finish. The downside is chiefly in terms of palate. Light to medium bodied but gassy and while that accentuates to citrus, it also disguises some of the other taste notes. Like many NEIPA, there is also some chalkiness in the finish. For me this slid from a possible 3.5 to a definitely no more than 3.1. Pity. |
