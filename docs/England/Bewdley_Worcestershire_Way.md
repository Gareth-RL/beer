| **Comments** | On the board as a bitter. Golden body white lace top. Grassy verging  on veg in the scent. Initial fruit sweetness but rapid lemony transit to medium bitter. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Never thought it would be better than the Wiper & True. |
