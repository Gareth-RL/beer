Brewer: Bang The Elephant Brewing
City: Langley Mill
Comments: Poured copper body with tan cream lace. Pleasantly malty aroma for a bitter.
  Taste is medium sweet with toffee notes and medium bitter with some languor. Medium
  bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Increasingly
  impressed by this outfit. I have had many a bitter less tasty than this.
