| **Comments** | Poured copper body with tan cream lace. Pleasantly malty aroma for a bitter. Taste is medium sweet with toffee notes and medium bitter with some languor. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Increasingly impressed by this outfit. I have had many a bitter less tasty than this. |
