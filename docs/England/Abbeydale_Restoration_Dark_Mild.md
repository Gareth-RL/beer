| **Comments** | Poured copper body off white lace top. Aroma of roasted malts earthy and autumnal. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with fruit notes lingering. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish . From a wooden barrel the landlord assures me and the scent and taste tell us this is true. But decent enough.  |
