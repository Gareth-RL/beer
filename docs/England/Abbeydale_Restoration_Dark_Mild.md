Comments: 'Poured copper body off white lace top. Aroma of roasted malts earthy and
  autumnal. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with fruit notes lingering. Medium bodied
  slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish . From a wooden
  barrel the landlord assures me and the scent and taste tell us this is true. But
  decent enough. '
