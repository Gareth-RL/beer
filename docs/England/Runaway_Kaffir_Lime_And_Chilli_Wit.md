BeerID: 629061
Brewer: Runaway Brewery
City: Stockport
Comments: Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours hazy cloudy yellow with white lace
  top. Aroma has lime and other citrus with light banana funk. Taste confirms the
  chili. So medium sweet with a spicy finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture
  although the spicy quality under cut it, average carbonation, and the chilies in
  the tail. Some may say that a little chili goes a long way with beer.
