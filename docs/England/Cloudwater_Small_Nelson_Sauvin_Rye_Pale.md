| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours cloudy orange golden with white lace top . Aroma has peach passionfruit grassy straw and spice. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour with a spicy note in there. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a languorous finish. Plenty to enjoy in this 2.9%abv. |
