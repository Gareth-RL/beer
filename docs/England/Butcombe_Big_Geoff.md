Comments: '"Cask. Aroma of roasted malts with toffee notes. Pours dark amber with
  off white lacing. Taste is medium to full sweet to light bitterness. Palate is slightly
  fuller than medium, although the texture is initially watery, carbonation soft,
  and a definite languorous wash to the gentle bitter finish. I&#39;m no connoisseur
  of the style but it is a winter warmer that I would happily drink again."'
