| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of roasted malts with toffee notes. Pours dark amber with off white lacing. Taste is medium to full sweet to light bitterness. Palate is slightly fuller than medium, although the texture is initially watery, carbonation soft, and a definite languorous wash to the gentle bitter finish. I&#39;m no connoisseur of the style but it is a winter warmer that I would happily drink again. |
