Comments: 'Aroma yes roasted to caramelized malts and berry hops. Pours a classic
  rich chestnut amber body although the lacing is thin. Taste is medium sweet to bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and bitter finish.  If
  it were a standard cask brewer I would say what else do you expect?  Decent enough.
  30/03/2024 second sipping why am I so miserly with bitter scores? I deliberately
  upped this one '
