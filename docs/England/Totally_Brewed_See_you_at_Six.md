| **Comments** | So of the six types of bean - 2 of coffee, Tonka, vanilla, cocoa, and jelly - only Tonka greets the nose. Poured dark mahogany body with tan lace top. Taste is sweet with vanilla and cocoa joining Tonka and I guess jelly beans are there in spirit. Palate is medium to light bodied sticky feel soft carbonation. Light bitter finish. There may be too many beans in the mix. Not a patch on the Voodoo they do so well. |
