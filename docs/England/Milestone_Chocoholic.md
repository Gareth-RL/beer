Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 8.0
Beer: Milestone Chocoholic
BeerID: 69072
Brewer: Milestone Brewing
City: Newark
Comments: Cask. Pours dark with thick cream head. Aroma cocoa with mild coffee notes.
  Tastes sweet milk chocolate with soft fruit undernotes and pleasant coffee languor.
  Overall a fine specimen of a beer that makes you forget it’s a beer. Although that’s
  too harsh as there is a bitter edge in the background but they have given it the
  name for a reason.
