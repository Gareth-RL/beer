| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and thin bubbly top broken lacing diminishing. Aroma roasted malts and caramel. Taste slightly watery on the palate but abiding biscuit malt savour. I can well imagine an evening in its company. A memory of a past unrealized. 09/04/23 second sip  |
