| **Comments** | Poured hazy pale orange with white lace top. Aroma has pine and passion fruit. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with grapefruit vying with passion fruit and the grapefruit won. Largely because the pine notes cut it off at the knees. Palate is medium bodied mineral texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A diffident New Englander if there is such a thing. |
