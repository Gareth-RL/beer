| **Comments** | Tap @theJunkyard. Pours cloudy amber with white lace foam. Aroma has lychee fruit and butterscotch malts with the caramel registering more on my senses than the fruit did. Taste is medium sweet with a souring to bitter finish but this never entirely erased the sweet malts. Palate in medium to full bodied given its creamy feel, carbonation soft to flat. Finish is languorous with bitter notes. Overall a pleasant double IPA that is best suited to sharing in a bottle than drinking alone. |
