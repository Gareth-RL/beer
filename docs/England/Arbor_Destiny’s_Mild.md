| **Comments** | Poured ruby chestnut body with tan cream lace. Aroma has strong hazelnut scent above dark fruits. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with stone fruits and hazelnut evident. Palate is medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. The granular feel persists. Notwithstanding the texture if this were the average for Mild, the style would undergo a renaissance. |
