Brewer: Arbor Ales
City: Bristol
Comments: Poured ruby chestnut body with tan cream lace. Aroma has strong hazelnut
  scent above dark fruits. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with stone fruits
  and hazelnut evident. Palate is medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish. The granular feel persists. Notwithstanding the texture
  if this were the average for Mild, the style would undergo a renaissance.
