| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours orange unclear golden body and thin lace. Aroma pithy citrus, pale malts, and bread. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with fruit to the fore and crumb malts flour at the end. Palate is medium bodied but decidedly sticky texture, average carbonation, and a clinging finish. Still finding my feet with DDH. But good. |
