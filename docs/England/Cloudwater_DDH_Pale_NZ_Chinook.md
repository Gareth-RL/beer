Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours orange unclear golden body and
  thin lace. Aroma pithy citrus, pale malts, and bread. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with fruit to the fore and crumb malts flour at the end. Palate is medium bodied
  but decidedly sticky texture, average carbonation, and a clinging finish. Still
  finding my feet with DDH. But good.
