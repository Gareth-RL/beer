Beer: Buxton / Fierce Beer Nippy Sweetie
BeerID: 570722
Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours a ruby copper brown with white lacing. . Aroma
  is quite definitely spicy and almost smoky. Taste is medium bitter sweet with a
  souring finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky, average carbonation, astringent,
  finish. I was swayed by the fact that the strongest approval of leading reviewers
  came from a  Scotsman. If only all &quot;heavy&quot; was this good.
