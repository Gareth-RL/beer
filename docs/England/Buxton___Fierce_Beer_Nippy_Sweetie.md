| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours a ruby copper brown with white lacing. . Aroma is quite definitely spicy and almost smoky. Taste is medium bitter sweet with a souring finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky, average carbonation, astringent, finish. I was swayed by the fact that the strongest approval of leading reviewers came from a  Scotsman. If only all &quot;heavy&quot; was this good. |
