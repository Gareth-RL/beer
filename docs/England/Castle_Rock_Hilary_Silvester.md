| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Gervase Warren. Pours chestnut brown body and white lace top. Aroma has roasted malts and floral hops. Taste is medium bitter lightly sweet. Palate is medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a soft finish that goes with the oily texture. Classed as a red ale. Palatable and good but otherwise unremarkable. A local brew for a local lady. |
