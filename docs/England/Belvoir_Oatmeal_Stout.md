| **Comments** | Bottle. Slightly surprised I have not reviewed this before since it has been around a while and I know the brewery pretty well. Poured dark brown with thin tan lacing that fell to a halo pretty quickly. The aroma has roasted malts certainly with a hint of chocolate and there are hints of other grains amidst the profile which was more licorice than chocolate to my nose. Taste is medium sweet transitioning to a reasonably bitter finish. Palate is more medium than full bodied, and it is smooth in texture despite some spicy grainy elements, carbonation is average, and I suspect it is better on tap. Overall, a pleasant little number but I think it lacks some richness across aroma taste and texture. It would certainly taste better after a walk around Burrough Hill! |
