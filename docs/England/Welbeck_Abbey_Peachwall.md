Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Welbeck Abbey Peachwall
BeerID: 540225
Brewer: Welbeck Abbey Brewery
City: Welbeck
Comments: Cask. Has an aroma of pale malts and hop fruits. But not especially peachy.
  Appearance is yellow amber with white lacing. Clear. Taste is medium sweet with
  a sour finish. Slightly oily on the palate. A bland blond, that makes me hope that
  Welbeck picks up its game soon...
