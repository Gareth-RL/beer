| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours a decidedly murky pale yellow and orange with visible sediment &#40;perhaps because the best before date is 18 days away&#41;. Aroma is pretty much lemonade. Taste is pretty similar, sweet and bitter lemon, the beer factor is evasive. Palate is medium to light bodied, thin feel, slick feel, lively, carbonation, sticky finish. I bought it because I had not tried a Radler &#40;sez Ratebeer&#41; and now I don&#39;t need to make that mistake again. |
