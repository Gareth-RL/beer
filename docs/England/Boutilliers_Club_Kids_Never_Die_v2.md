| **Comments** | Floral sour yeasty nose pours hazy orange body with white lace. Taste is medium sweet to sour with good fruit  Mango and pomegranate noted. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a sour finish. Overall it has a lot more character than several saison ales around currently. |
