BeerID: 741040
Brewer: Wander Beyond Brewing
City: Manchester
Comments: The aroma is overpowering - more strawberries than Wimbledon. Pours peachy
  orange with lush lacing. But the taste is medium sweet to nowhere and the palate
  is light to watery soft and fizzy. Who would ever order a pint? Novelty beer.
