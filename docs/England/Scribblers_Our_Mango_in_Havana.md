| **Comments** | Poured golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has definitely mango fruit although it's so intense as to be more essence than fruit. Taste is medium sweet strongly fruity bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Somewhat artificial but that ironically maybe due to the honeyed quality of the underlying malts. Easy drinking. |
