Comments: '"Poured golden body with thin lace top. Aroma has definitely mango fruit
  although it''s so intense as to be more essence than fruit. Taste is medium sweet
  strongly fruity bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Somewhat artificial but that ironically maybe due
  to the honeyed quality of the underlying malts. Easy drinking."'
