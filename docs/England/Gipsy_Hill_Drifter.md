| **Comments** | At Brewdog Nottingham. Pours cloudy orange brown with white lace top. Aroma has caramel malt and citrus hops &#40;in my opinion they are not getting along&#41;. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, thin to medium, maybe, texture oily, carbonation soft to average, and a bitter finish . The Americans have nothing to fear. |
