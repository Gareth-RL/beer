Comments: '"The scent is unlikely to win you. Pale malt below vomit. But it looks
  good golden body with white lace top. Taste is hoppy and the bitter pithy bite grows.
  So it''s personal preference. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a long bitter finish. Refreshing (apart from the scent)."'
