| **Comments** | The scent is unlikely to win you. Pale malt below vomit. But it looks good golden body with white lace top. Taste is hoppy and the bitter pithy bite grows. So it's personal preference. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Refreshing (apart from the scent). |
