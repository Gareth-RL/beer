| **Comments** | Cask. You know what you will get wth Greene King. Something unspectacular. Given the hop revolution, IPAs have surged from brewers small and large. This has no scent of note, sacrificed on the altar of corporate balance. It has a good look. Rich golden brown - amber highlights. But that cannot conceal its bland taste for real ale drinkers who have cask and craft offering that push all the IPA buttons. A sip and you know why Castle Rock and Thorn bridge and many more prosper. One can only hope thereâ€™s a re-think. |
