| **Comments**  | Poured clear golden body white lace top. Aroma zesty citrus and pine hops. Medium sweet to bitter with increasing pine notes. Medium to light body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I tried it to compare with the Everard's West Coast IPA and it's better in terms of zest but it is keg and slightly gassy so that might deter a session                                                                                       |
