Comments: '"Poured clear golden body white lace top. Aroma zesty citrus and pine hops.
  Medium sweet to bitter with increasing pine notes. Medium to light body smooth texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. I tried it to compare with the Everard''s
  West Coast IPA and it''s better in terms of zest but it is keg and slightly gassy
  so that might deter a session "'
