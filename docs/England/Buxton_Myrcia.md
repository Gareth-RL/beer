| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma has cereal, herbs, dough, definitely a  wholegrain pale. Even an oatmeal one. Pours murky cloudy yellow orange with broken diminishing lacing. Taste is lightly bitter. Palate is slightly above medium bodied due to sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Is it as good as the collaboration? Better raters can judge. |
