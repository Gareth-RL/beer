| **Comments** | Tap. There is a whiff of citrus but muted. Pours amber, cloudy with white top that laces. If you read the brewers notes you may wonder where the coconut lemony scent went but on drinking there is a coconut moment before the bitterness takes hold. I actually found this beer more intricate in the finish on the palate than it was initially on the nose. This may well do it few favors since that first moment is telling. But taste wise, it begins lightly sweet, sours and finishes medium bitter. One suspects later attempts will be better. But it is already a cut above the typical session pale. |
