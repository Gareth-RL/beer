| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder Nottingham. Pours black with creamy tan top. Aroma has milk chocolate notes amidst roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter and not as sweet as I expected. Palate is medium to full bodied with creamy texture average carbonation and a long finish. A creditable effort. |
