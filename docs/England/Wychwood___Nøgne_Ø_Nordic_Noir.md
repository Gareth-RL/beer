| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma with hints of coffee and chocolate. Pours dark body and thin tan cream head. Certainly a smooth taste with some licorice sweetness but no great body. It needs some caramel or toasted malts to bolster what is there.What malts there are are too subtle for their own good. A bit disappointing. |
