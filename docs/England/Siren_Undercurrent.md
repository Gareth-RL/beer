| **Comments** | Aroma of grassy hop and light caramel malts with some citrus notes. Pours clear pale body with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter more pronounced. Palate is thin, watery feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. The undercurrent for me was a growing sense of disappointment with the siren more a warning than a lure. |
