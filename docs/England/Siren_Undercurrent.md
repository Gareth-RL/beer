Beer: Siren Undercurrent
BeerID: 204309
Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Aroma of grassy hop and light caramel malts with some citrus notes. Pours
  clear pale body with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter
  more pronounced. Palate is thin, watery feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. The undercurrent for me was a growing sense of disappointment with the siren
  more a warning than a lure.
