Comments: '"Black body tan lace. Aroma dark malt and coffee. Medium bitter going well
  with coffee spine. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. Nice easy drinking ale 27-07-24 second sipping and still easy. Bar listed
  as Rock Leopard hence I thought ''new to me '' @GOODFELLOWGEORGE . 01-10-24 third
  time and the same mistake.  But still a decent stout "'
