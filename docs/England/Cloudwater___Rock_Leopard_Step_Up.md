| **Comments** | Black body tan lace. Aroma dark malt and coffee. Medium bitter going well with coffee spine. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nice easy drinking ale 27-07-24 second sipping and still easy. Bar listed as Rock Leopard hence I thought 'new to me ' @GOODFELLOWGEORGE . 01-10-24 third time and the same mistake.  But still a decent stout  |
