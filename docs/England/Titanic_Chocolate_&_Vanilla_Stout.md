| **Comments** | Direct from the barrel. The vanilla and chocolate is fragrantly evident. Pours expresso black with bubbly head but no lace. A rich mouthful with the vanilla accenting the sweetness of the roasted malt. The chocolate lurks. There is a bitterness left on the palate but this is exactly what it says - chocolate & vanilla. A change rather than a habit. I suspect it could do wonders on draft at a care home that needed to cure overcrowding. A kindness. Second sipping 16/01/20 still full of vanilla and chocolate. Decent |
