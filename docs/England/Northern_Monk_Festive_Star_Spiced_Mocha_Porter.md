Comments: '"Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black body tan lace halo. Aroma
  has coffee bean malts and cinnamon and nutmeg spices. Taste is medium sweet to lightly
  bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a creamy
  spice finish. If you need a festive beer, there''s worse choices. 9/01/19 a second
  sipping confirms my opinion and happy new year!"'
