Beer: Hydes Ruby Celebration Ale
BeerID: 772708
Brewer: Hydes Brewery
City: Salford
Comments: I would not want a ruby this dull brown nor a celebration this flat. Some
  malt and fruit in the nose but hardly festive. Taste is insipid light sweet to bitter
  with maybe some more malt in the finish. Palate light oily feel soft carbonation
  and a light bitter finish. A disappointment.
