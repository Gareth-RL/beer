| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. I was expecting a pungent orange scent but this is relatively muted and more Terry&#39;s than tangerine. Pours mahogany brown with a creamy top. More citrus evident in the taste which is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Overall pleasant but not the jaffa cake I was expecting. |
