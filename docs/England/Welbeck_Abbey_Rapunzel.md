Comments: Poured golden body white lace top. Aroma of spicy grain and citrus zest.
  Medium sweet to bitter with not a lot to report. The grain goes biscuit and the
  citrus is grapefruit. Medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish with pith. Passable and bought to compare to Limestone Ein Stein.
