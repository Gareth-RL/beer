Comments: '"Cask. Aroma was muted for me: some hops and bread malts but no pungency.
  Pours amber with a white top. The taste has a strong hoppy edge with some malty
  undertow to soften the finish. It is possibly suffering by invidious comparison
  with the Simcoe I drank immediately before. Re-rated as it is better on second visit.
  Some richness in the savour but still no great scent considering the strength and
  hops used."'
