| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and tan lace. Aroma has coffee dark malts and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium to light body edging watery which is not great in a stout. Texture is oily and tongue curling which is also unusual. Finish is blunt. I note that it hasn&#39;t troubled a reviewer in a while and it troubles this one since I like stout. |
