Comments: '"@central railway beer festival Quorn. The beer  is the highest rated on
  offer here. Aroma of roasted malts light caramel and berry notes. Pours dark brown
  almost mahogany body. Poured from the barrel so very little lace. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with a hoppy finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Good flavour for the abv and I like dark mild."'
