| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and thin bubbly top. Malty nose with some stewed fruits. Taste is toasty with roasted malt and hints of toffee. More sticky than smooth on the palate with a lingering fruitiness. Miss Danvers will be satisfied which is a rare thing. 09/05/18 Another ruby ale that improves on revisiting.  |
