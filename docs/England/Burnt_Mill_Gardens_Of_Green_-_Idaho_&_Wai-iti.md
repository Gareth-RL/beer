Beer: Burnt Mill Gardens Of Green - Idaho & Wai-iti
BeerID: 813869
Brewer: Burnt Mill Brewery
City: Stowmarket
Comments: Looks like orange juice with thin white head. Aroma has pine, melon and
  a hint of mango and kiwi. Taste is briefly sweet but mostly a resinous and grassy
  bitterness with more pith than fruit. Palate is medium bodied, dank feel, soft to
  fine carbonation, and a bitter slightly mineral finish heading towards NEIPA.  Regular
  sipping can keep the bitter charge slightly at bay by renewing the fruity beginning
  but this also accentuates the bitterness as the tide ebbs. It reminded me more of
  Manchester than of either Idaho or New Zealand; possibly because I have experienced
  some dankness there as well. It is interesting (at least to some) that as a word
  dank is far less negative in the beer community than elsewhere.
