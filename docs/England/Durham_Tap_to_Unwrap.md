| **Comments**  | A mixed bag. Poured cola brown body thin off white lace (I expect a stout to have fuller lace). Aroma of dark malts and orange essence both muted. (I'd want more of the first chocolate and caramel ideally). Medium sweet to bitter with some orange and some chocolate but neither richly. Thin to medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Again more would be better. In short, don't seek it out. I found it @mistrollininn.                                                                                      |
