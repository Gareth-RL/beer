| **Comments** | Cask at the Blue Monkey. Pours dark brown with ruby lights and thin tan lace top. Aroma has rye bread and chocolate with just a hint of smoke. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sour with some hop berry fruits noted. Palate is medium bodied, but thin and watery feel, flat carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall a good effort since too many smoked porters are like an ashtray. |
