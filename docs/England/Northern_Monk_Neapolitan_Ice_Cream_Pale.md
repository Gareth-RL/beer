| **Comments** | Keg. Impressive getting that vanilla strawberry vibe on the nose. Pours hazy orange with white lacing. The taste leads with the sweet elements cream strawberries and some vanilla but there is a chocolate bitter back note. The most interesting experiment Iâ€™ve witnessed in a while. So probably my favourite novelty beer of the moment. |
