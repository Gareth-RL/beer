Comments: Keg. Impressive getting that vanilla strawberry vibe on the nose. Pours
  hazy orange with white lacing. The taste leads with the sweet elements cream strawberries
  and some vanilla but there is a chocolate bitter back note. The most interesting
  experiment I’ve witnessed in a while. So probably my favourite novelty beer of the
  moment.
