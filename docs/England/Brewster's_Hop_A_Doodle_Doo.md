Comments: 'Cask. Malt with floral hoppy notes. Pours copper with thin scummy top and
  broken lacing. Taste is well balanced with some light grapefruit edge to the caramelized
  malt and biscuit. No more than medium bodied with a slight grassy finish. An acceptable
  session ale but I wouldn’t seek it out. 6/02/24 second sipping many years later.
  Slightly more malty in the scent. More lace. Otherwise the same but I have mellowed. '
