| **Comments** | Cask. Malt with floral hoppy notes. Pours copper with thin scummy top and broken lacing. Taste is well balanced with some light grapefruit edge to the caramelized malt and biscuit. No more than medium bodied with a slight grassy finish. An acceptable session ale but I wouldn’t seek it out. 6/02/24 second sipping many years later. Slightly more malty in the scent. More lace. Otherwise the same but I have mellowed.  |
