MyScore: 3.3
Comments: Bottle. Poured slightly hazy, golden body with full foam white lace top. Fruity aroma heading towards peach. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with more soft fruitiness at the front and a light bitterness and smooth pale malt finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation for bottled beer, bitter finish. I did try to see if this commissioned beer matched the brewery's existing ales and my guess was Honey Moon, but it was not more than that. If you happen to be in the National Railway Museum in York and remember that there is a family member who loves beer, you could do worse than give them a treat! That's what my son did.
