Brewer: Furnace Brewpub
City: Derby
Comments: Poured golden amber body thin white lace. Aroma of winegum fruit and floral
  hops.  Medium sweet to bitter citrus tang. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. A side string to Shiny, which I suspects
  takes up most of the brewers energy.
