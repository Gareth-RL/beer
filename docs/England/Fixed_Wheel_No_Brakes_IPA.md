Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Fixed Wheel No Brakes IPA
BeerID: 295184
Brewer: Fixed Wheel Brewery
City: Halesowen
Comments: Cask. Aroma has toffee malt and citrus hops. Appearance is clear golden
  with a white lace top. The taste is richly hopped with a tangerine almost marmalade
  thread that melds sweet and bitter nicely. The finish is long and the carbonation
  is average. Not a standout but still better than many IPA out there.
