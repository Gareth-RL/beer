Beer: Charnwood Ermintrude
BeerID: 515106
Brewer: Charnwood Brewery
City: Loughborough
Comments: Cask. A milk mild and some lactose in the scent. Copper body white top with
  lasting lacing. Taste medium sweet but pretty bland with a malted milk insipidness.
  A beer to forget from a brewery that can do better. 23/05/24 second sipping and
  I forgot that I had had it. Doh
