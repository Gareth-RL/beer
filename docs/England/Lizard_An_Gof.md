MyScore: 3.2
Comments: Bottle. Pours copper amber almost chestnut body off white foam head. Aroma of roasted malts and berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some more hedgerow berries at the front and a definite bitter finish. Medium bodied, slightly sticky texture, average carbonation and a drying bitter finish. Overall, it's not a strong ale I will seek out, although looking at other reviews it seems to be better if you get it fresh rather than bottled.
