Comments: '"Bottle. Pours copper amber almost chestnut body off white foam head. Aroma
  of roasted malts and berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some more
  hedgerow berries at the front and a definite bitter finish. Medium bodied, slightly
  sticky texture, average carbonation and a drying bitter finish. Overall, it''s not
  a strong ale I will seek out, although looking at other reviews it seems to be better
  if you get it fresh rather than bottled."'
