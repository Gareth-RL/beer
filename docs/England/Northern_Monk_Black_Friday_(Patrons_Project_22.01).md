Beer: Northern Monk Black Friday (Patrons Project 22.01)
BeerID: 789503
Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.
City: Leeds
Comments: Aroma of vanilla and raspberry which I guess is why it references Manchester
  tart pastry. Poured black bodied with tan lace. Taste is sweet of course with the
  soft berry fruits enveloping the chocolate and coffee rather than the other way
  around. Palate is medium to full bodied slick creamy feel, average carbonation and
  a light sour finish but overall sweet pastry is dominant.  A little goes a long
  way.
