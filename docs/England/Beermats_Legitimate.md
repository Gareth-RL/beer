Comments: '"bottle from Adventure. Poured dark chestnut amber body with thin off-white
  lace. Quite a malty scent but with some berry fruits as well. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with caramel from the malts and hedgerow fruits from the hops. Palate
  is medium bodied, texture slightly floury, carbonation average, and a bitter finish.
  I remain convinced that being able to rate styles like bitter well, when they favour
  moderation and balance in most departments, is a great skill. It''s beyond me"'
