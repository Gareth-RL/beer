Brewer: Shiny Brewing
City: Little Eaton
Comments: Tap at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden body thin lace top. Aroma
  is bread, cereal, herbs, spruce, a hoppy non-citrus pale. Taste is medium to light
  sweet to bitter with a sour tang to finish. Palate is medium to full bodied with
  sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a crisp finish. I liked it without
  wanting to date it regularly.
