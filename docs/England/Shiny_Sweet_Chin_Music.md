| **Comments** | Tap at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden body thin lace top. Aroma is bread, cereal, herbs, spruce, a hoppy non-citrus pale. Taste is medium to light sweet to bitter with a sour tang to finish. Palate is medium to full bodied with sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a crisp finish. I liked it without wanting to date it regularly. |
