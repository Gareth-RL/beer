| **Comments** | Aroma of muted peach and pineapples. Pours murky orange golden with white lace diminishing. Taste is light sweet to medium bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, average carbonation and a long crisp bitter finish that is very refreshing. Overall a decent summer session beer, but not for anyone seeking sweetness. |
