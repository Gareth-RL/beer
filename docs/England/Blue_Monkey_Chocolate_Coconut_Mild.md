| **Comments** | Aroma has the coconut flakes more than the chocolate. Pours reddish brown with thin lace . Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter note surfaces from the confectionery. Overall plenty of flavour for a 4%er. 14/05/24 second sipping 5 years later on the Mild Trail at the Organ Grinder in Arnold. Nothing to add. |
