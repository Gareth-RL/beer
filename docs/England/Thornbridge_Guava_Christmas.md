| **Comments** | Seeming brewed for the Christmas/ beer advent calendar market. Certainly has an aroma of tropical fruits of which guava is one. Pours pale golden with thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a slight herbal finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, slick feel, average to soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Pleasant enough as an easy drinking accompaniment to the often heavy dishes of an English Christmas. |
