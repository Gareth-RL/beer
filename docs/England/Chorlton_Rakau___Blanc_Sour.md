Comments: '"Tap at Junkyard. Pours murky cloudy golden brown like plums and peaches
  in a blender. Small off white lace. Aroma stewed fruits edging towards orange but
  through a mesh of rhubarb. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium and sticky,
  soft to flat carbonation, and a sour finish. I&#39;d no clue what to expect as rakau,
  blanc sour is a new beer recipe for me. But refreshing and with enough fruit in
  the mouth to delude you that this is healthy&#033;"'
