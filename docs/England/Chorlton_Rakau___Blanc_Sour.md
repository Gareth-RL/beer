| **Comments** | Tap at Junkyard. Pours murky cloudy golden brown like plums and peaches in a blender. Small off white lace. Aroma stewed fruits edging towards orange but through a mesh of rhubarb. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium and sticky, soft to flat carbonation, and a sour finish. I&#39;d no clue what to expect as rakau, blanc sour is a new beer recipe for me. But refreshing and with enough fruit in the mouth to delude you that this is healthy&#033; |
