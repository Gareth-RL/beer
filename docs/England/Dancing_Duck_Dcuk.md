Comments: '"Bottle. Bewildered how I have never reviewed this beer before; it is easy
  to find in these parts. Poured clear pale golden with lasting white foam top. Aroma
  is piney hop with a hint of citrus, but as usual the marketing people overstate
  their case; it''s hardly overwhelming. Taste is similarly more of the same hoppiness
  with a momentary juiciness giving way to a longer souring bitterness. Some grapefruit
  pith especially in the finish. So let''s be generous and call it refreshing. What
  it needs is sunshine and a nice beer garden. Palate is medium bodied, average to
  above carbonation, some drying in the mouth, and a long bitter finish. Some would
  see it as a session beer, but the conversation would have to compensate. "'
