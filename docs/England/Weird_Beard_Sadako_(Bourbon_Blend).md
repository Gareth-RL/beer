| **Comments** | Dark brown body and tan lace. Scent is dark malt with not as much vanilla as Bourbon BA usually produces. Taste is richly textured sweet caramel and coffee and some bourbon at the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. A decent imperial but below my expectations given earlier versions of the beer. |
