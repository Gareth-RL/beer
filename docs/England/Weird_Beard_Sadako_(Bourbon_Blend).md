Beer: Weird Beard Sadako (Bourbon Blend)
BeerID: 681657
Brewer: Weird Beard Brew Co.
City: Ealing
Comments: Dark brown body and tan lace. Scent is dark malt with not as much vanilla
  as Bourbon BA usually produces. Taste is richly textured sweet caramel and coffee
  and some bourbon at the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft
  carbonation and a long finish. A decent imperial but below my expectations given
  earlier versions of the beer.
