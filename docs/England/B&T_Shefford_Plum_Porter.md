Beer: B&T Shefford Plum Porter
BeerID: 293473
Brewer: B&T Brewery
City: Shefford
Comments: Cask. Pours very dark with bubbly tan head. Aroma of stewed plums/prunes.
  Taste is fruity and biscuity with hops pushed aside. Quite a watery mouth feel.
  It suffers by comparison with Titanic which I tasted and rated highly recently so
  I’m conscious that the bar has been set high. I would certainly have the other half.
