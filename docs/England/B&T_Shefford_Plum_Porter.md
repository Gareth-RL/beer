| **Comments** | Cask. Pours very dark with bubbly tan head. Aroma of stewed plums/prunes. Taste is fruity and biscuity with hops pushed aside. Quite a watery mouth feel. It suffers by comparison with Titanic which I tasted and rated highly recently so Iâ€™m conscious that the bar has been set high. I would certainly have the other half. |
