| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma muted citrus and floral hops. Pours golden pale with thin lace head. Tastes fruity to begin but there’s bread and biscuit there as well. Light to medium with a grassy tang. Selected largely because I’m in the CR tap and no new darker offerings are available. It signals in a good way that it is time to move on. |
