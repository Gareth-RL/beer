Beer: Castle Rock Screech Owl
BeerID: 94543
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma muted citrus and floral hops. Pours golden pale with thin lace
  head. Tastes fruity to begin but there’s bread and biscuit there as well. Light
  to medium with a grassy tang. Selected largely because I’m in the CR tap and no
  new darker offerings are available. It signals in a good way that it is time to
  move on.
