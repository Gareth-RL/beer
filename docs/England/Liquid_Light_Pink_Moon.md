| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy pink with white lace halo. Pretty if profoundly unlike traditional English ale. Aroma is fragrantly raspberry bramble. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is light to watery, thin texture, soft to flat carbonation, and a residual milky film. I liked it more than this suggests but it&#39;s an oddity. |
