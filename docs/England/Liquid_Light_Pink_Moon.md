Comments: '"Tap at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours cloudy pink with white lace halo.
  Pretty if profoundly unlike traditional English ale. Aroma is fragrantly raspberry
  bramble. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is light to watery, thin
  texture, soft to flat carbonation, and a residual milky film. I liked it more than
  this suggests but it&#39;s an oddity."'
