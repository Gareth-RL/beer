| **Comments** | Keg at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Pours dark amber with off white lace. Aroma has caramel chocolate nuts and coffee hmm sounds like a praline? Taste is medium bitter and sweet but there is more bitterness than I anticipated. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Nicely done. |
