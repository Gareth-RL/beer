Comments: '"Cask. Aroma has muted herbal hop and pale malts. Pours clear golden with
  white foam top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a biscuit finish. Palate is
  medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a long finish. Happy birthday&#033;
  Thanks especially for Guerrilla, Infinity, and Ape."'
