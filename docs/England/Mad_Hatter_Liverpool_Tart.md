Beer: Mad Hatter Liverpool Tart
BeerID: 329497
Brewer: Mad Hatter Brewing Co.
City: Liverpool
Comments: Keg. Aroma lightly peach, floral notes. Pours pale yellow hazy gold white
  lacing. So far so good but the key element is a balanced Gose that has enough sourness
  without being merely a lemon rinse. Thus the taste is initially medium sour with
  some sweet notes but it finishes well to refresh the palate with a sour kick. Nice.
