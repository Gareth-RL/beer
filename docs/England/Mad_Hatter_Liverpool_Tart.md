| **Comments** | Keg. Aroma lightly peach, floral notes. Pours pale yellow hazy gold white lacing. So far so good but the key element is a balanced Gose that has enough sourness without being merely a lemon rinse. Thus the taste is initially medium sour with some sweet notes but it finishes well to refresh the palate with a sour kick. Nice. |
