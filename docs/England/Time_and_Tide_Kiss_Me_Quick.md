| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours very pale clear yellow gold with lace top. Aroma has berry fruits and pale malts. Taste is medium bitter with a sour edge to the finish. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average to soft carbonation, and a slightly sour finish. Plenty of flavour for the abv |
