| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is mainly roasted malt. But thereâ€™s a hint of fruit. Pours chestnut with ruby lights. Thin lace. Taste has some plum says my tongue &#40;poor bewildered creature&#41; lain upon a biscuit base with fruit skins a plenty in the aftertaste. Medium to full with some viscous wash on the palate. Not bad but compared to the stout and the porter, this Flipside ale leaves me ambivalent. But they have refurbished the Lord Roberts nicely  |
