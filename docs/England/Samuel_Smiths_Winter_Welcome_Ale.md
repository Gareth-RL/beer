Comments: '"Poured a clear amber brown body with white lace top. Aroma: roasted malts,
  hint of berry fruits and light spice. Taste: medium sweet to bitter with a little
  caramel at the front and a little spice in the finish. Medium bodied, slightly grainy,
  average carbonation, and a spice trill in the finish. Pleasant. I wonder if I can
  bring myself to go through the process of collecting the label on the bottle. Made
  for the Jubilee and available after the funeral. "'
