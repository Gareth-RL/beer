Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma light chocolate and peanut
  but not over the top. Taste medium sweet to bitter cocoa powder at the front and
  peanut to be rear. Light to medium bodied watery feel soft to average carbonation
  and a light salted finish. Decent although I like my stout to have more body in
  the tongue. They control the flavours nicely '
