| **Comments** | Always unnerving to see the beer on the bar is out of production according to Ratebeer. Poured clear pale golden with thin lace top. Emphatic Mandarina hop scent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter still citrus dominant. Palate is watery  fizzy feel, bitter finish. But it's body won't win fans. Still a session IPA |
