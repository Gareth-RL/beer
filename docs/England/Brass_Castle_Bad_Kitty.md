| **Comments** | From the barrel at Lincoln Green Beer festival. Pours black with bubbly tan lace top. Aroma chocolate coffee and vanilla. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Tasty stuff. 31/10/18 a second visit and still good. |
