| **Comments** | Can from Raptor taproom. Pours pale hazy golden with loose off white foam top. Aroma is the predictable gamut of tropical fruits--grapefruit in the lead, with pineapple and papaya coming alongside and expect a late dash from citrus since the going is juicy to pithy. Taste is medium sweet to sharply bitter as that citrus pith wraps itself around the palate. Certainly a refreshing IPA and as the brewer readily concedes, it's little to do with Christmas so get thee merry gentlemen and don't forget to wash those socks by night. |
