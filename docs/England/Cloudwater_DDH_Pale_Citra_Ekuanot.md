Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard Nottingham. Pours hazy golden with thin white lace halo.
  Aroma has tropical fruits pineapple and tangerines with pale malt inflection. Taste
  is medium to light sweet to?, it fluctuates and is mainly sweet. Palate is medium
  bodied but with a fuller grain texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long
  finish. I was both pleased and puzzled by this. Eminently drinkable but murky in
  tastes and palate.
