Comments: Tropical fruit aroma peach pineapple maybe lychees. Poured the predictably
  murky golden body with thin lace of an NEIPA. Taste is medium sweet and fruity.
  Lightly souring to a bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation
  and a bitter finish. The usual high standard.
