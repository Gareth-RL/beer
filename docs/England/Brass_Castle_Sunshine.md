Beer: Brass Castle Sunshine
BeerID: 164312
Brewer: Brass Castle Brewery
City: Malton
Comments: Cask. Pours copper to amber body thin white lace top that yields strong
  lacing. Aroma grapefruit and lemon marmalade. Taste has a similar preponderance
  of hops with muted biscuit malt. The citrus flavours linger on the palate and it
  has a soft finish. Pleasant but I want more complexity in a 5.7% beer. I guess that
  is why it’s an American pale.
