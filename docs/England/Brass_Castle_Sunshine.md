| **Comments** | Cask. Pours copper to amber body thin white lace top that yields strong lacing. Aroma grapefruit and lemon marmalade. Taste has a similar preponderance of hops with muted biscuit malt. The citrus flavours linger on the palate and it has a soft finish. Pleasant but I want more complexity in a 5.7% beer. I guess that is why itâ€™s an American pale. |
