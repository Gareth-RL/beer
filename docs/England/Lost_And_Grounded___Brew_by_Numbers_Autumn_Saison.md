| **Comments** | Tap. Pours unclear amber brown with halo of off white lace. Aroma has toast, bread, herbs, leaves, woody, earthy, yeast scents. Taste is medium sour to sweet. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. This one grew on me. More farmhouse than Saison perhaps. |
