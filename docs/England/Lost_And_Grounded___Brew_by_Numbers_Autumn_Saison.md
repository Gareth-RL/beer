Beer: Lost And Grounded / Brew by Numbers Autumn Saison
BeerID: 555421
Brewer: Lost And Grounded Brewers
City: Bristol
Comments: Tap. Pours unclear amber brown with halo of off white lace. Aroma has toast,
  bread, herbs, leaves, woody, earthy, yeast scents. Taste is medium sour to sweet.
  Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. This
  one grew on me. More farmhouse than Saison perhaps.
