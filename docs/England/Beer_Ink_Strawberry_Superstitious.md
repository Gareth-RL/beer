Comments: Strawberry nose. Think ice-cream. Pours cloudy orange juice with lace halo.
  Lactose in the first mouthful so medium sweet to sour. Palate is light to medium
  bodied, clammy feel, soft to average carbonation, and a light sour finish. For me
  a good strawberry stands in oxymoronic relationship to sourness. So I approached
  this with trepidation. Thus composed, I declare it good. The strong scent is thankfully
  not matched in the taste. A bit thin with just a bit too much dairy effect.
