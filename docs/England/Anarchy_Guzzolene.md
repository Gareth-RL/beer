| **Comments** | Tap at The Overdraught . Fruity aroma but without guidance I would not spot the lychees&#39;. Pours hazy golden with halo of lace. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. An oddity. Pleasant but not session worthy. |
