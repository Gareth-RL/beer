BeerID: 462364
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. A variant I assume on the Woolly BM’s ESB but up from 5.2 to 6.2%.
  A dark fruity aroma with cinder toffee notes. Pours dark with a thin pale bubbly
  top. A fruitcake in the mouth with date, treacle, and spice. A soft finish and even
  if its not an imperial stout, it’s well worth a try.
