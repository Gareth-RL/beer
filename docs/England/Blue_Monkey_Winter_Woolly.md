| **Comments** | Cask. A variant I assume on the Woolly BM’s ESB but up from 5.2 to 6.2%. A dark fruity aroma with cinder toffee notes. Pours dark with a thin pale bubbly top. A fruitcake in the mouth with date, treacle, and spice. A soft finish and even if its not an imperial stout, it’s well worth a try. |
