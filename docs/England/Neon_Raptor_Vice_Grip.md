| **Comments** | Mango pineapple guava etc in the scent. Pours cloudy orange golden body with thin lace in the New England style. Taste is initially fruity sweet but quickly sours to a sharp bitterness but retaining the fruity backnote. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a slightly chalky bitter finish. Refreshing and full of crushable fruit flavours. Good stuff. |
