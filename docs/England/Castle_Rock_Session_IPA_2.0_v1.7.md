| **Comments** | Citrus marmalade nose. Hazy pale orange body scummy lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and sour with some biscuity notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture average carbonation and a murky finish slipping between bitter and sour as it subsides. Bottom line is I wouldn't fancy a session of this. |
