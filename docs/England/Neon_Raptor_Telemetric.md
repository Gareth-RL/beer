Comments: '"Aroma is heavy on tropical soft fruit especially mango. Pours a dank orange
  murkiness with lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour and the final finish
  is not to my taste. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a long
  finish with a sour note. One in their repertoire that I may avoid (there''s few
  in that category and I suspect others will gulp it down eagerly)."'
