Comments: '"Can. I mistook the candle as a sign that this might be a Christmas seasonal
  product. It''s more a summer pale. Poured clear golden body with white lace. Aroma
  is strongly pine with citrus notes in the background. Taste is lightly sweet to
  increasingly bitter so it ends as crisp refreshing ale. Palate is light to medium
  bodied with average to sparkling carbonation. There is some residual mouth coating
  as the dry bitterness builds. For me, it needs a summer beer garden rather than
  a misty damp December night to be at its best"'
