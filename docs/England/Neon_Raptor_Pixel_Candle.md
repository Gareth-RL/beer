| **Comments** | Can. I mistook the candle as a sign that this might be a Christmas seasonal product. It's more a summer pale. Poured clear golden body with white lace. Aroma is strongly pine with citrus notes in the background. Taste is lightly sweet to increasingly bitter so it ends as crisp refreshing ale. Palate is light to medium bodied with average to sparkling carbonation. There is some residual mouth coating as the dry bitterness builds. For me, it needs a summer beer garden rather than a misty damp December night to be at its best |
