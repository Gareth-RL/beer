Comments: '"Cask at the Canal House on the Mild trail. Pours copper with bubbly tan
  top.. Slightly sourdough yeasty scent. Tastes soft and fruity with berry fruits
  to the fore so the malts are in the background as a sour base. Some bitterness on
  te palate but no coconut evident to me. Despite the warning that it contains nuts.
  Not as exciting as its deScr&#105;ption. For fans of HMS Bounty. Mr Grundy’s Blighty
  was on the next pump."'
