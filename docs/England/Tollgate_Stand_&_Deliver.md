| **Comments** | Cask. This is a bitter. Once a staple it rarely gets more than 3.3 so this is a generous rating for a beer that sums up British bitter. Few will ponder the scent. There are berry hop fruits and just a hint of pale malt biscuit. It pours the classic amber brown body and white lace top. Taste is &#40;surprise surprise&#41; modestly bitter with very little to add. Palate is medium bodied, oily &#40;but in a nice English way&#41;, average carbonation which means by the standards of commercial lager, soft. Overall, a beer to nurse while watching the madness of the planet spin around you. |
