| **Comments** | Cask at The Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours orange amber with off white lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt and fruit rind hops. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation and a crisp bitter finish. Seems like a session bitter to me. |
