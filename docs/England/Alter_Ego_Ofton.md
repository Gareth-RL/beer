| **Comments** | Can. Poured cloudy golden; I expect lager to be clearer than this. White foam head but not a gusher like the previous 3 cans from the same brewery. Aroma of pale malts and floral hops. Medium sweet to lightly bitter but with a sour note in the after taste. Medium bodied, oily rather than crisp, average carbonation and a bitter souring finish. Not a great lager, but if this were a beach on a hot day, it would work. |
