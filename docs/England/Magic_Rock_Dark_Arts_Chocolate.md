| **Comments** | Tap. Wow&#033; Aroma coffee. Chocolate. Caramel malts even a hint of whiskey. Pours black with thin tan top.. Taste is richly chocolate imbued but settles to a medium sweetness Medium to full bodied. Soft to nil carbonation. Finish is somewhere between oily and creamy on the palate. My colleague love it and I was impressed. |
