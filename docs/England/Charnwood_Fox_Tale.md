Comments: '"Pours light brown chestnut body with thin lace top. Aroma has toffee malt
  and herbal hops. Taste is medium sweet with a nice transition to a light bitter
  finish. Some hints of nut and notes of grain. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture,
  average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall a better than average bitter,
  which I feel these days is not as compelling a style as it once was; although I''ll
  concede that this may partly be due to its being the opposite of the styles that
  dominate: namely the fruity pales, the richly malted, and highly fueled. If this
  was on the bar, it would be my regular bitter."'
