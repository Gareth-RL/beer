| **Comments** | Poured amber body with white lace top. Light honeyed malt note in the scent. Tastes medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Maybe a hint of spice, but unlike others it doesn't spoil a decent malty pale. |
