| **Comments** | Aroma of dark malts and berry hops. Pours dark brown body with tan foam lace. Taste is medium sweet malt to bitter hop with a sharp drying finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, its different elements clashed for me. It could have been a dry bitter IPA without the interference of dark malts. |
