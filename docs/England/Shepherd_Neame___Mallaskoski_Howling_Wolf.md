BeerID: 786283
Brewer: Shepherd Neame
City: Faversham
Comments: Some light spice and some malts in the scent but hardly aromatic. Poured
  very clear amber body with thin lace rapidly diminishing. Taste is similarly malt
  focused with some light spice and a general medium bitter effect which lacks the
  depth or richness that I look for in a winter ale. Palate is medium to thin body
  some sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a light spice finish. A bit bland
  for the type.
