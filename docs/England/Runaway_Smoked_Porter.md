| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black with cream foam top. Aroma is intense: roasty, coffee, nuts, licorice, and of course smoke. Taste is medium sweet to bitter especially at the end. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Despite my sweet tooth I like a smoked ale and this one is well done  |
