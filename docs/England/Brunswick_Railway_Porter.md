| **Comments** | Given how long this local porter has been around I am bemused to find I have never rated it. Poured dark brown with red lights and tan cream lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with dark malt evident edging towards licorice rather than caramel. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly a porter I could drink, although not one I will seek out. 2nd sipping 20)01)21. Unchanged |
