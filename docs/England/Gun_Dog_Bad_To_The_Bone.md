| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma toasted malts and floral hops but modestly. Pours amber with white top yielding lace wash. Taste medium bitter with salty finish. Carbonation is light. Palate is medium bodied and soft. I wish it were better but I am relieved itâ€™s no worse. 25/10/19 second sipping. No change. Maybe the bottled version is slightly better. |
