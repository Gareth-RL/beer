Brewer: Gun Dog Ales
City: Woodford Halse
Comments: Cask. Aroma toasted malts and floral hops but modestly. Pours amber with
  white top yielding lace wash. Taste medium bitter with salty finish. Carbonation
  is light. Palate is medium bodied and soft. I wish it were better but I am relieved
  it’s no worse. 25/10/19 second sipping. No change. Maybe the bottled version is
  slightly better.
