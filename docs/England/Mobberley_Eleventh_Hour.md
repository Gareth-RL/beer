Beer: Mobberley Eleventh Hour
BeerID: 686161
Brewer: Mobberley Brewhouse
City: Lower Peover
Comments: Cocoa boozy aroma. Poured black bodied with tan lace top. Taste is medium
  to full sweet which slowly transits to a light bitter chocolate. So not for the
  embittered. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a smooth chocolate
  finish. An end of session dessert treat. But good to see Mobberley branching out.
