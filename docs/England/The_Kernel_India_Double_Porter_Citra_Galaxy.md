Comments: '"Tap at the Canal House Nottingham. Pours black with tan foam creamy head.
  Aroma has coffee malts and citric hops. Taste is medium sweet to occluded sour.
  Slight bitter residue. Palate is medium to more in terms of body, texture rich,
  oily rather than sticky and pleasant as well &#40;I can imagine this, a quiet fireside,
  and a good book&#41;. Overall, if one could only cope with the ABV, this would be
  a porter to savour and whereas an Imperial porter is always a small measure beer
  for many reasons, this is a second helping beer, if it were not 7.4%."'
