Comments: Poured golden body thin lace top. Aroma of peach and pineapple. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with more pineapple fruit and a hint of melon at the front and some solid pale malts at the back. Steady transition and a long finish makes for a very solid IPA. I am generally skeptical of Blue Monkey's dabbling in the craft ale market; partly because I cherish their core cask range. But this is excellent.
