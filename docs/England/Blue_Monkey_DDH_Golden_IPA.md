Comments: '"Poured golden body thin lace top. Aroma of peach and pineapple. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter with more pineapple fruit and a hint of melon at the front
  and some solid pale malts at the back. Steady transition and a long finish makes
  for a very solid IPA. I am generally skeptical of Blue Monkey''s dabbling in the
  craft ale market; partly because I cherish their core cask range. But this is excellent."'
