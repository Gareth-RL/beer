Comments: 'Still bemused by black IPA.  I see the dark body and tan head and think
  malt and smell the pine and citrus from the hops.  Medium to light sweet to medium
  bitter with a little licorice to baffle the hop register of citrus and resin. Medium
  bodied lively feel average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I would fail every
  blind tasting of this one. '
