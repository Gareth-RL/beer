Comments: 'Aroma has roasted malts with berry hops. Pours clear dark amber body with
  frothy off white lace.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium
  to light bodied, oily texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish.
  Reminds me of bygone beers but not in a good way '
