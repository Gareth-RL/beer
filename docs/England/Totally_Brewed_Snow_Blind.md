Comments: '"Aroma of vanilla and chocolate malt. Poured amber with lace top. Taste
  is medium sweet mocha notes and milky. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft
  carbonation and a bitter finish. We need another name for white stout. But for those
  who like sweet stout it''s worth a try. (An earlier version of this review via the
  phone app decided not to score 4 of the 5 categories giving this one of my lowest
  ever scores!)"'
