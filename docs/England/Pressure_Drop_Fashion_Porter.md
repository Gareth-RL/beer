Beer: Pressure Drop Fashion Porter
BeerID: 774705
Brewer: Pressure Drop Brewing
City: Tottenham Hale
Comments: Aroma has coffee dark malt. Poured dark brown tan lace.. taste is medium
  sweet to bitter coffee notes. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average
  carbonation and a long finish. Solid rather than exceptional. 29/01/20 second sipping
  due to gift of a can. Coffee and dark chocolae remain dominant and it remains a
  decent enough porter.
