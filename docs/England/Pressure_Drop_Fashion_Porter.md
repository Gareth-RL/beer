| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee dark malt. Poured dark brown tan lace.. taste is medium sweet to bitter coffee notes. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish. Solid rather than exceptional. 29/01/20 second sipping due to gift of a can. Coffee and dark chocolae remain dominant and it remains a decent enough porter. |
