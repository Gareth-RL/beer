Beer: Summer Wine Cortes
BeerID: 588846
Brewer: Summer Wine Brewery
City: Holmfirth
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours clear golden body with white lace
  top. Aroma is herbal and pine resinous to me. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a long finish.
  Maybe a tribute to Willamette. But no groundbreaker.
