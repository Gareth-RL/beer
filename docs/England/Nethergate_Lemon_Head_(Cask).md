Comments: Cask. Without guidance I would not have spotted the ginger in the scent.
  For me it was funky and spicy like a curried burp. And I like my blondes blonde.
  This can pass for amber with a thin lace top. Fortunately after an unalluring start
  it settles well in the palate so that the finish is far better. Not sure if it would
  sell under the name lemon bottom but its nether regions are better than those closer
  to the gate.
