| **Comments** | Cask. Pours clear copper brown body with white lace top. Aroma is hop fruits and bread malts. Taste is medium sweet and then strengthening bitterness with the standard twig finish. A session bitter of no great distinction or offence. 27/02/24 2nd sipping. I'm on a 7 year loop. Tasted in 2017.  I can't say I disagree with the rating much but I am just kinder in my scores these days  |
