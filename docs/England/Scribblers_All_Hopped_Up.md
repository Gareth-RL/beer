| **Comments** | Aroma has tropical fruit and herbal hops. Pours amber golden body with tight and lasting white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a dry finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a dry bitter finish. So most Scribblers beers edge towards sweetness but this craft beer primarily for the can marked taps the dry side. Mainly in the finish. Solid. |
