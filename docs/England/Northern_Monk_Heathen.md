| **Comments** | Not sure why this rating has been private due to no description but the possibilities are endless. It's a fruity NEIPA so that is what you smell tropical fruit. And it pours regulation cloudy hazy golden pale body with white lace diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a fruit note evident throughout. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average to soft carbonation and a long finish. Let's hear it for the heathens? Best said with a Southern evangelical drawl. |
