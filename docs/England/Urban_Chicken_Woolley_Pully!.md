Comments: Poured rich amber body cream lace.  Aroma of roasted malts and dark fruit.  Hints of chocolate and toffee.  Medium sweet to bitter with caramel and dates. Chocolate only a little.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I liked it but am drawn to the dark, strong Milds when I find them.
