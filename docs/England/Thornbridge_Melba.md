| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy yellow with thin white lace. Aroma is richly peachy with herbs, lurking. Distinctive. Taste is medium sweet with a growing sour finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture, soft carbonation, long finish. I wish I had it available for picnics but it has brought a whiff of summer to an autumnal Nottingham evening. |
