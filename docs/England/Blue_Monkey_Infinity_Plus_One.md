Comments: '"Cask at the Organ Grinder. Aroma tropical fruit pineapples and peaches.
  Golden body and thin top. The taste is fruity too but mellow more gentle syrup than
  citrus. Possibly a toffee note or something to enhance the smoothness. I have had
  the Infinity in the past but this is better. For someone who favours the darker
  end of the beer spectrum, this is a pleasant surprise. 28/01/20 still better than
  Infinity which sounds more impressive every time you say it. But judging by other
  reviews it''s not traveling well. Less enthusiasm in Scotland or Scandinavia."'
