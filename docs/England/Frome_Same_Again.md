| **Comments** | I suspect that Milk Street had a similar beer. So maybe an alias.  Aroma has biscuit malts and hedgerow hops.  Pours golden body and white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. It's a decent session summer beer. |
