| **Comments** | Cask. Licorice stout offers licorice to the mouth more than the nose, although it is more dark malts and fruity hops on the latter. It&#39;s also brown rather than black, and the creamy lace head thins rapidly. So maybe the stout label misleads. This is something else &#40;God bless it&#41;. Taste is sweet and bitter in due moderation with the licorice qualities in the background.  Palate is thin for stout, medium for porter &#40;is it  a licorice porter?&#41;  feel is sticky, average carbonation, bittersweet finish. A distinctive addition that can be enjoyed by more than licorice lads. |
