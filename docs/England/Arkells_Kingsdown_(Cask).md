| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has soft fruit and roasted malts. But modestly. Pours orange amber with white lace top that spreads intermittently on drinking (a long-winded way of saying broken lacing). It has a bittersweet finish and fruit notes as promised. And honest advertising is so rare these days that I added 2 to the overall score just for this. Having said that it is still solid rather than spectacular. 20/01/24 some years later and I had failed to check if it was unrated. Unspectacular indeed |
