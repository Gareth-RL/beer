| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma has licorice and coffee malts richly scented. Pours black with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter and the latter is bitter chocolate. Palate is medium to full, creamy, soft to average carbonation, languid finish. Still wondering how the vanilla keeps so far back so that it is more an aftertaste. Very nice. |
