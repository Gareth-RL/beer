| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee with tan halo. Is coffee bean medium roasted. Taste is sweeter. Medium to full and not much diminished. Texture is creamy, body is medium carbonation is the average side of soft, and finish is more clammy than long. I wanted to like this more than I did. But in the hall of flavoured porters, it deserves a place. |
