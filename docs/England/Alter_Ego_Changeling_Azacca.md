| **Comments** | Can. Pours a very murky cloudy orange with thin scummy top (depending on your pour, my second, less measured attempt brought a white foam top). Strong aroma of mango, grapefruit, pineapple and peaches. Taste is medium sweet with a little souring in the finish to a light bitter after tang. Some spiciness also on second sipping. Palate is medium bodied, slightly cloying on the tongue, average carbonation and the sour to bitter finish but less chalkiness than in some NEIPAs. It certainly showcases the Azacca, and does what it promises. However, I tend to favour the mix over the single hop just to add some complexity to the taste. Decent enough but it would depend what else was on the menu. |
