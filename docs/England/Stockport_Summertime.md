Comments: Solid. In many respects a good example of the majority of cask brewed in
  UK currently. Golden bodied with white lace. Lemony citrus hops and pale malt. Taste
  is lightly sweet to bitter. Some fruit in the hop and some biscuit in the malt.
  Light to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.
  Session worthy.
