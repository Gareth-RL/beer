| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House Nottingham. Pours dark brown with ruby lights. Halo of off white lacing. Aroma has peanut butter to the fore and banana to the rear. Taste is medium to full sweet as the banana kicks in. Palate is medium at best in terms of body but the feel is smooth enough and copes with the bana slide that predominates the taste. Carbonation soft, and the finish is sweet. Considering that this came after a very fine Imperial Porter and had flavours that can be intrusive, it exceeded expectations. |
