Beer: 'Wilde Child Siege of Khartoum '
BeerID: 614127
Brewer: Wilde Child Brewing Co
City: Leeds
Comments: Tap at the Canal House Nottingham. Pours dark brown with ruby lights. Halo
  of off white lacing. Aroma has peanut butter to the fore and banana to the rear.
  Taste is medium to full sweet as the banana kicks in. Palate is medium at best in
  terms of body but the feel is smooth enough and copes with the bana slide that predominates
  the taste. Carbonation soft, and the finish is sweet. Considering that this came
  after a very fine Imperial Porter and had flavours that can be intrusive, it exceeded
  expectations.
