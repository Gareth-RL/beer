Comments: 'Aroma promises a slow start with heavy going. Straw hops and pale malt.  The
  ale is a good looking filly with golden body and white lace. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter but stays the course. Palate is a good weight with no handicap, oily texture
  average carbonation and a brisk finish for those who relish the final furlong.   '
