| **Comments** | Aroma promises a slow start with heavy going. Straw hops and pale malt.  The ale is a good looking filly with golden body and white lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but stays the course. Palate is a good weight with no handicap, oily texture average carbonation and a brisk finish for those who relish the final furlong.    |
