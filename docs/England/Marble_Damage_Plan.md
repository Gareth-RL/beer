| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has a tropical medley with pineapple and mango evident pours golden with white lacing. Taste is richly malted but with a fruity accompaniment. Quite full bodied for a simple IPA. Soft carbonation and a sour finish. I liked it even it would see me under the table after a couple of pints. |
