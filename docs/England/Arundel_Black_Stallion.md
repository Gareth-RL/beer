Beer: Arundel Black Stallion
BeerID: 145602
Brewer: Arundel Brewery
City: Arundel
Comments: Cask. Aroma dark chocolate malts and yeasty sugars. Pours dark brown with
  thin tan lacing. Taste retains the malts emphasis but there are fruit notes lurking
  so that the sweetness is medium and the finish is soft. A tingle of bitterness in
  the finish. Overall it does a lot with a little.
