| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma dark chocolate malts and yeasty sugars. Pours dark brown with thin tan lacing. Taste retains the malts emphasis but there are fruit notes lurking so that the sweetness is medium and the finish is soft. A tingle of bitterness in the finish. Overall it does a lot with a little. |
