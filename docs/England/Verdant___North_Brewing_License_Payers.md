Comments: Tap at the Junkyard where currently no dark beer drinkers find a thing.
  This IPA pours murky orange gold with white top. Its aroma is strongly fruity citric
  along a plateau from tangerine to pink grapefruit. But I have started to notice
  the nasal equivalent to background noise with some craft ales that go with citric
  tropical fruit hops and that is toothpaste. Not in its unadulterated form of course.
  Just the effect that you might get one morning from your breakfast juice. Taste
  is less befuddling. Medium sweet light bitterness and sourness to close. Palate
  is light to medium bodied. Texture has thin feel, soft carbonation, bitter finish.
  A worthy effort but as we old folks say &quot;no cigar.&quot;
