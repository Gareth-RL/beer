Beer: Batemans Salem Brew Dark Fruits Porter
BeerID: 684168
Brewer: Batemans
City: Wainfleet
Comments: Some plum and maybe fig in the scent to justify the name.  Pours cough syrup
  dark with ruby tint and diminishing lace. Taste is medium sweet with more clearly
  plums. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a light
  bitter finish. But bland for a porter except for the pluminess.
