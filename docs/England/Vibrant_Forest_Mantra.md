Beer: Vibrant Forest Mantra
BeerID: 700782
Brewer: Vibrant Forest Brewery
City: Hardley
Comments: Poured hazy golden body with white lace diminishing. Aroma has citrus pineapple
  hops. Taste is light sweet to medium bitter so quite bitter for an APA in my experience.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Seems
  decent enough but one was enough, so not session worthy.
