| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John. Pours dark chestnut brown body tan lace top. Aroma has light caramel malts and floral hops. Taste is medium bitter . Palate is medium bodied, watery feel, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall a fairly standard malty ale that could prove session worthy. |
