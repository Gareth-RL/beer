| **Comments** | Aroma has chocolate cake and caramel malts. Pours dark brown body with thin tan lace top. Taste is medium to full sweetness with a light bitter finish. Palate is medium to thin body sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish with some spice. A brownie to guide you. 11/12/23 second sipping at the Crown Beeston. I liked it more the first time flavour wise. But it is still a decent sweet stout. |
