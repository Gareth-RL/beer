Comments: Aroma has chocolate cake and caramel malts. Pours dark brown body with thin
  tan lace top. Taste is medium to full sweetness with a light bitter finish. Palate
  is medium to thin body sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish
  with some spice. A brownie to guide you. 11/12/23 second sipping at the Crown Beeston.
  I liked it more the first time flavour wise. But it is still a decent sweet stout.
