| **Comments**  | Poured amber body thin lace top. Aroma of berry hop and roast malts. Medium sweet to bitter well balanced with a fruit note that lasts through to the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. As good a bitter as I have tasted in a while..                                                                                      |
