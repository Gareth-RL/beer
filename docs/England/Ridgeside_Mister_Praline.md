| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with tan cream lace top.  Aroma has chocolate cake malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with cocoa notes. Palate is thin to medium bodied too thin for stout. Texture is more clammy than creamy or sticky. Carbonation more average than soft.  I should have gone for the porter. |
