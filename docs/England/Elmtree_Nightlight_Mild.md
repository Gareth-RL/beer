| **Comments** | Bottle from Beautiful Beers. Poured cola black with no head to speak of. Aroma of roasted malts light hint of liquorice and dark stoned fruits. Taste is more richly fruited, date and fig feature, with a nutty feature; it could be Christmas. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture, soft carbonation, and a lasting finish. It is a pity that I believe that a mild should have a head on it! and a bit more oomph in the malty scents. But taste and palate would make this a mild that I would be happy to return to. Milds, even the older stronger recipes, are a challenge to brewers (seemingly) so this should be commended. |
