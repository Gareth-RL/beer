| **Comments** | Can purchased at the Taproom and drunk at home. Poured black body with decent tan lacing. Aroma is emphatically chocolate peanut butter, although the taste transits from medium to full sweetness to a definite medium bitterness that builds as you drink. The drink delivers less sweetness than I feared. Smooth and medium to full bodied, with soft to average carbonation and said bitter finish. I would rate it higher if I could imagine drinking a second (one is enough). |
