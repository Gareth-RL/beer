Comments: Poured hazy pink with lace. Aroma of bubble gum and berries. Taste is medium sweet with watermelon and raspberry jam. Medium bodied slightly sticky texture average carbonation and a light finish. More fruit pop than beer but hey, it kept me occupied until the pizza was ready next door. @ Good Fellow George
