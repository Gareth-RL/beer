| **Comments** | light hoppy aroma some pine but its scent wont win you. Brown copper body and white lace top, mostly lasting. Dry crisp bitter taste and according to my son lugubrious but moreish. Biscuit malt and strong hoppy but not as sharp as many IPA. Medium bodied, smooth velvety feel despite the average or above carbonation in the bottled form, decent bitter finish. The offspring recognised that it was not an APA as most understand it, but they really liked it and I record their judgment |
