Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body with tan cream lace top.  Aroma of chocolate coffee malts with cocoa powder. Medium sweet to bitter with more dark chocolate malts evident. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Disadvantaged by the chill from the keg but still well crafted for an oatmeal stout
