Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body with tan cream lace top.  Aroma of chocolate
  coffee malts with cocoa powder. Medium sweet to bitter with more dark chocolate
  malts evident. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  Disadvantaged
  by the chill from the keg but still well crafted for an oatmeal stout
