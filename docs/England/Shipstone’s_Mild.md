| **Comments** | Cask at The Trip to Jerusalem. Pour dark chestnut tan foam top.. Aroma has caramelized malts and berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a long fruit finish. Very nice. 2nd sipping on the 2023 mild trail Nottingham @ Malt Shovel Beeston 3rd sipping on 2024 trail and this time it's at the Johnson Arms. |
