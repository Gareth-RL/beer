| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden pale body with white lace top. Aroma has grapefruit citrus pineapple notes. Taste is medium sweet souring softly to bitter with a gentle finish. . Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a light finish. This is the third NEIPA of theirs that I have added and as variants on a theme, this is the easy drinking one. It's also deceptively the strongest in abv. |
