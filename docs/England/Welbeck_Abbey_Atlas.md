| **Comments** | Poured clear orange golden body white lace top. Light citrus and pine scent. Taste lightly sweet to medium bitter some bread malt some grassy hop. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Like others, unsure of the White IPA classification unless that's a synonym for the West Coast pale it aspires to be. Decent enough 20/04/24 second sipping as it's the guest ale at the Organ Grinder  |
