| **Comments** | Gravity @Nottingham beer festival. Pours brown with ruby lights and some thin lacing. Aroma is caramelized malts with vanilla notes. Taste is toffee and sweet biscuit and the medium body makes for a rich but easy flowing beer. Just what you need at a festival when the silly hats proliferate. |
