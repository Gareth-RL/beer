Comments: '"Gravity @Nottingham beer festival. Pours brown with ruby lights and some
  thin lacing. Aroma is caramelized malts with vanilla notes. Taste is toffee and
  sweet biscuit and the medium body makes for a rich but easy flowing beer. Just what
  you need at a festival when the silly hats proliferate."'
