| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body thin tan cream lacing. (you won't mistake it for Guinness). Aroma of coffee and chocolate malts. Lightly sweet to medium bitter. The roasted malts deliver the coffee ground and dark chocolate flavours but there is not much caramel to sweeten. So not as rich as some, and the same goes for texture. Medium bodied, smooth, average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish with some languor. Decent example of the dry stout style                                                                                      |
