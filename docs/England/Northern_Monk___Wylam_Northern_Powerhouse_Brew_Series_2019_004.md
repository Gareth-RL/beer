BeerID: 744692
Brewer: Northern Monk Brew Co.
City: Leeds
Comments: Aroma has lots of tropical fruit on the citrus side tangerine grapefruit
  lemon zest. Pours like orange juice you would not know it was beer. White lace halo.
  Taste is medium sweet but sours quickly like the moment when your orange juice meets
  your toothpaste. Medium bodied at best,  watery feel, soft carbonation, and a sour
  and bitter finish. Yet the score suggests that my misgivings belie its content.
  As sours go, this rocks. Second sipping still orange
