| **Comments** | Tap. Some oak on the nose but otherwise it is a malty beast. Pours brown clear body with white lace top. Taste is medium to strong sweetness with light sourness. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and finish remains sweet. Maybe 90 days is not enough. Disappointing  |
