Comments: '"Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma of coffee and lactose. Medium
  to full sweet thanks to the lactose with a bitter coffee grounds finish -quite a
  contrast. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and that bitter lingering
  finish. For me they''ve overdone it too sweet and then too bitter."'
