| **Comments** | Cask. Nuts, roasted malts, cereal, bread, are all in the scent but subtly so. Pours a deep dark brown with copper lights and a thick creamy off-white head. Very enticing. Taste has a medium to strong sweetness in the caramel range but the hops come through to provide a soft bitter finish. Slightly surprised that I haven’t reviewed this before since it is not the first encounter. Well worth a return. |
