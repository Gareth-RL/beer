Beer: Pheasantry Mikado Mild
BeerID: 268373
Brewer: Pheasantry Brewery
City: Newark
Comments: Cask. Nuts, roasted malts, cereal, bread, are all in the scent but subtly
  so. Pours a deep dark brown with copper lights and a thick creamy off-white head.
  Very enticing. Taste has a medium to strong sweetness in the caramel range but the
  hops come through to provide a soft bitter finish. Slightly surprised that I haven’t
  reviewed this before since it is not the first encounter. Well worth a return.
