Comments: '"Cask at the Kean''s Head. Pours dark reddish chestnut brown with tan lace
  diminishing. Aroma has some dark coffee malts and a hedgerow berry or two. Taste
  is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a light bitter finish.  Palate is thin bodied
  even in terms of porter v. stout. Carbonation is soft, and the finish is long but
  only lightly bitter. A tasty porter all the same and I wonder if the name plays
  mainly on the Portobello or on the porter? I may have a second sipping to assess
  my parsimony. 07/9/23 over 3 years before the second sipping but what a 3 years
  for everyone. Up a point overall as the fruit came through more. 29/10/24 it''s
  come around sooner but I missed the porter it replaced which was from welbeck abbey.  Still
  a safe choice "'
