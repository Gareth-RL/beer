| **Comments** | Can. Pours hazy orange body with lace top. Aroma has grapefruit and bakers sugar. Taste is juicy sweet to sour with a little chalkiness in the finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, some drying in the mouth, average carbonation and a pithy finish. A decent beer for the glimpses of sunshine that Nottingham is enjoying at the moment |
