Brewer: Totally Brewed

Comments: Can. Pours hazy orange body with lace top. Aroma has grapefruit and bakers
  sugar. Taste is juicy sweet to sour with a little chalkiness in the finish. Palate
  is light to medium bodied, some drying in the mouth, average carbonation and a pithy
  finish. A decent beer for the glimpses of sunshine that Nottingham is enjoying at
  the moment
