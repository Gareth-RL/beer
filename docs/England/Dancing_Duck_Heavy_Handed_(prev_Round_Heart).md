Beer: Dancing Duck Heavy Handed (prev Round Heart)
BeerID: 179560
Brewer: Dancing Duck Brewery
City: Derby
Comments: Cask. The house ale at the Hand and Heart Nottingham. A session bitter.
  And that is what it is used for. 4/07/18 NB Now rebranded as Heavy Handed following
  the sale of the Roundhouse. But still a session bitter. Biscuit malt and hop fruits
  aroma. Pours copper with thin white lace top. Taste is medium bitter with sweet
  fruit notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average carbonation, and a bitter
  finish. Still a very safe bet.
