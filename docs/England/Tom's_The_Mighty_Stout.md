| **Comments** | Rich dark malt scent. Poured dark brown body thin tan lace top. Taste medium sweet to bitter chocolate and berry fruits. A hint of treacle. Medium bodied at most watery texture average carbonation and a grainy malt finish. A lot more flavour than some oatmeal stouts I have encountered recently  |
