| **Comments** | Aroma contains the promised vanilla and maple syrup adding to the caramel malt effect. Poured rich brown amber body with white lace. Taste is medium sweet which takes a while to transit light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. A lot of ingredients push the sweetness. It may not suit some 2nd sipping. 13/12/21  still a sweet red ale with a vanilla note. |
