| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma is fruity whether it is passionfruity depends on your familiarity with said fruit which isn&#39;t in my daily intake frankly. But scent wise I feel it lies between mango and lychee. The funky non-citrus side of tropical. Taste is medium bitter eventually but through a fog darkly. You have some fugg to get through. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a one of those finishes that raise the nose, It stays more than it lingers. But it is not a  bad beer just one you won&#39;t insist on. |
