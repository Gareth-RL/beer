Brewer: Siren Craft Brew
City: Finchampstead
Comments: Tap. Aroma is emphatically coffee with amaretto notes. Pours black with
  thin tan top broken lacing. The taste has rich dark chocolate and coffee notes with
  liquor resonance. Like a n expresso at the end of a great meal, this fits. But not
  by the pint. Tis the new world order.
