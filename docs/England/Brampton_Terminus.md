Brewer: Brampton Brewery
City: Chesterfield
Comments: Bottle from Adventure Beer Company. Poured clear golden body thin white
  lace. Light scent of tropical fruits and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter,
  with a hint of apricot for me. Palate is light to medium bodied, slight sticky texture,
  average carbonation, and a bitter slightly jammy finish. As the bottle proclaims
  this is an easy-drinking golden ale.
