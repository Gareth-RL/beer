Beer: Nelson Pursers Pussy
BeerID: 85158
Brewer: Nelson Brewery
City: Chatham
Comments: Aroma plums and chocolate. Dark body, ruby lights, thin tan top. Chocolate
  malts evident in the taste with sweet soft fruits. Probably too sweet for most and
  certainly the better porters have licorice or earthy malts and a hoppy balance,
  which this does not. Some bitterness at the finish and some carbonation, but not
  enough to give life or adequate balance. I suspect the Admiral won’t go down the
  Pursers route again.
