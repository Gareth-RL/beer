| **Comments** | Aroma plums and chocolate. Dark body, ruby lights, thin tan top. Chocolate malts evident in the taste with sweet soft fruits. Probably too sweet for most and certainly the better porters have licorice or earthy malts and a hoppy balance, which this does not. Some bitterness at the finish and some carbonation, but not enough to give life or adequate balance. I suspect the Admiral won’t go down the Pursers route again. |
