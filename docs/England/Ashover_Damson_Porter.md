| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma is a delicious blend of coffee and fruit. Pours dark with beige cream top. Broken lace. It tastes understandably fruity with the plum notes strongly foregrounded but there is more there if you can detect it. Caramel malts and berry hops to name just two. Palate is medium bodied but creamy. Ranks alongside Titanic. |
