Comments: '"Cask. Aroma caramel roasted malts atop butterscotch, or possibly the other
  way round. It&#39;s malty. Pours clear amber copper body and white top. Taste is
  medium sweet light initial bitterness . Texture is medium bodied with average to
  soft carbonation and a n oily feel. The finish is bitter and there&#39;s some languor.
  Overall a tasty IPA."'
