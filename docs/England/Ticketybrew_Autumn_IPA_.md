| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma caramel roasted malts atop butterscotch, or possibly the other way round. It&#39;s malty. Pours clear amber copper body and white top. Taste is medium sweet light initial bitterness . Texture is medium bodied with average to soft carbonation and a n oily feel. The finish is bitter and there&#39;s some languor. Overall a tasty IPA. |
