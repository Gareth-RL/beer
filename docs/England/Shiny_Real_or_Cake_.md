| **Comments** | Poured brown body tan halo. Aroma of chocolate predominantly with raspberry jam at the back. Medium to full sweet with bitter dark chocolate finish. Medium bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. I was happy that the raspberry remained in the background. A decent pastry stout |
