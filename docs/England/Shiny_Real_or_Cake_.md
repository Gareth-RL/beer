Comments: Poured brown body tan halo. Aroma of chocolate predominantly with raspberry
  jam at the back. Medium to full sweet with bitter dark chocolate finish. Medium
  bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. I was happy
  that the raspberry remained in the background. A decent pastry stout
