Beer: Ashover Coffin Lane Stout
BeerID: 87400
Brewer: Ashover Brewery
City: Clay Cross
Comments: Barrel at Derby Winter Beer Festival. Pours dark. No lace or top of note.
  Aroma has chocolate coffee malts aplenty. And that sets the tone for a fine stout.
  May be more fruit maybe more spice but in terms of body and languor a worthy effort.
