| **Comments** | Pours hazy pale golden like a NEIPt with scummy lacing. Aroma has tropical fruits grapefruit and pineapple.  Taste is medium sweet with juice transitioning to pithy bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, chalky texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish. I suspect the sharply bitter finish could wear over a session.  |
