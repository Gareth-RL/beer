| **Comments** | Berry hops and pale malt (for delicate, read muted aroma).  Poured pale golden with thin lace top. Taste is lightly sweet but medium bitter maybe a hint of lemon citrus. Palate is thin to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. For easy drinking read dull.  |
