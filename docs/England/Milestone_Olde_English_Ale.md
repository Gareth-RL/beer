Beer: Milestone Olde English Ale
BeerID: 134915
Brewer: Milestone Brewing
City: Newark
Comments: Cask. Pours murky copper with tan foam top. At least on this occasion. Caramel
  malty aroma. Tastes unsurprisingly sweet and biscuity with a wholemeal tang. I worry
  that it may be the end of the batch since there’s a staleness to it. And suspect
  it may have better days.
