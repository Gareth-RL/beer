| **Comments** | A standard cask bitter. Pours chestnut body with white lace top. Aroma has bready malts and berry hops. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.. It could have been made 50 years ago and then we would have been more impressed. |
