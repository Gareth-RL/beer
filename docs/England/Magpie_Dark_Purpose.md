Comments: 'Dark brown body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of milk chocolate and caramel
  malts.  Medium to full sweet to lightly bitter with lactose and muscovado sugar
  accentuating the sweetness.  Medium bodied silky smooth texture average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish.  Nice for those of us who need sweetening '
