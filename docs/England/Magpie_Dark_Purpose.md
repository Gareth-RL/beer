| **Comments** | Dark brown body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of milk chocolate and caramel malts.  Medium to full sweet to lightly bitter with lactose and muscovado sugar accentuating the sweetness.  Medium bodied silky smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Nice for those of us who need sweetening  |
