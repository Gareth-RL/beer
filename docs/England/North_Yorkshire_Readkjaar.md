BeerID: 584435
Brewer: North Yorkshire Brewing Co.
City: Warrenby
Comments: Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours chestnut with ruby
  lights and a foamy white lace top. Aroma has floral hops and roasted malts. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. Overall I suggest anyone jaded by the sameness of cask bitter
  should sip a lager beforehand. Then you realise why bitter is precious.
