| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours chestnut with ruby lights and a foamy white lace top. Aroma has floral hops and roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall I suggest anyone jaded by the sameness of cask bitter should sip a lager beforehand. Then you realise why bitter is precious. |
