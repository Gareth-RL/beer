Comments: 'Cask. Aroma floral rather than cereal. Dark body tan cream head. The malts
  come through in the taste in a low key biscuit kind of way. Not sure where the honey
  went. Soft carbonation and some coating of the palate. But overall unassuming, if
  not bland. 6/10/23 second sipping. Much improved. The honey is evident and the malts
  shine through '
