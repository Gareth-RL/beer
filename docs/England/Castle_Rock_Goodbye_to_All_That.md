| **Comments** | Cask at the Canal House Nottingham. Pours clear chestnut body with ruby lights and off white lacing. Aroma has emphatically cherry and some citric hop behind and pale malt. Taste is medium sweet to sour and always cherry. Palate is medium bodied,oily feel, average carbonation, light sour finish. A tribute to WWI centenary, - the only thing good about war is the peace.  |
