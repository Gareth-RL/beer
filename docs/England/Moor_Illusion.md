Comments: '"Tap. Special release. Sometimes the craft brewers share their pain in
  the American way. &#40;read the commercial description&#41;. Anyway this black IPA
  smells piney to me, although not in an intense way. It pours dark with a persistent
  tan lacing. It actually tastes good with some pleasant hoppiness and a smooth finish.
  I just wish they would let the beer speak longer than the marketing guy. This is
  not America."'
