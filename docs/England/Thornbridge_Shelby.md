Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Thornbridge Shelby
BeerID: 823164
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Aroma is lightly citric, thinly malty. Pours a clear copper body with a
  rapidly dissipating white lace head. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some berry
  notes and a bitter biscuit finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, average carbonation
  but quite a lively texture and a bitter finish. Certainly easy drinking but somehow
  one expects more from Thornbridge.
