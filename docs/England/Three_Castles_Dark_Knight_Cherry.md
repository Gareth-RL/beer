Brewer: Three Castles Brewery

Comments: Poured dark ruby chestnut body with thin tan lace top. Aroma of cherry and
  roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter coming early and
  staying although the cherry lingers too. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average
  carbonation and a long finish. A decent cask flavoured stout.
