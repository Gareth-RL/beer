Comments: '"Cask. Pour mahogany brown with thin white top and broken lacing. Aroma
  of roasted malts and bread. Taste is similar with some dried dark fruits and yeast.
  Medium body with some coating to the palate. Good without being great. Second sipping
  after the plague 15 Aug 21. There''s a hint of liquorice in the finish and the dark
  fruits come through but don''t block the bitter finish. Better."'
