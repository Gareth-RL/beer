Beer: Castle Rock Andy Turner
BeerID: 433124
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma of soft berry fruits. Pours golden brown with white top and
  strong lacing. Taste is very soft initially with candy like coating that melts to
  a lingering bitterness. Advertised as a session IPA but I suspect most drinkers
  would prefer the Harvest Pale for a session.
