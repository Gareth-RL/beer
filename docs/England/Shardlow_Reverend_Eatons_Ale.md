| **Comments** | Cask. Some stewed fruit and yeast in the scent. Pours honey brown with thin top. It seems to be here to make the other beers taste good since itâ€™s the blandest thing on the menu. This is the downside of trying new ale. You can have a run of indifferent pints. The aftertaste is tolerable but it really should be preceded by a taste.. |
