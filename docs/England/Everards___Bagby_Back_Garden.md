Comments: '"Cask. What aroma there is is grain. Better to look at than drink, having
  an orange gold body and white top. Taste is beer identikit: malt tick, hops tick
  and water big tick. Light bodied with a soft sweet finish. Quite the opposite of
  crisp. He came 3,000 miles and died/ To make a beer o’er which we cried. I hope
  Emerson forgives me."'
