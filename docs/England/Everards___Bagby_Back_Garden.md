| **Comments** | Cask. What aroma there is is grain. Better to look at than drink, having an orange gold body and white top. Taste is beer identikit: malt tick, hops tick and water big tick. Light bodied with a soft sweet finish. Quite the opposite of crisp. He came 3,000 miles and died/ To make a beer o’er which we cried. I hope Emerson forgives me. |
