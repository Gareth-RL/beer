Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark brown almost black with creamy tan lace
  halo. Aroma has roasted malts, chocolate, licorice, dark fruit and alcohol. Taste
  is medium sweetness, medium bitterness, with a light salt. Palate is full, creamy,
  thick feel, sticky, soft to flat carbonation, and long finish, with the alcohol
  burn to the rear. I guess I am getting used to the form since my expectations are
  higher, and this one doesn&#39;t use all the room it has to play."'
