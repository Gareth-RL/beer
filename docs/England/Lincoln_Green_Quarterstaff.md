BeerID: 297098
Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Cask at the Sir John. Aroma roasted toasted maybe even burnt malts with
  stone fruits underneath. Plus dark cola with scummy top. Taste has more bitterness
  with licorice and cough syrup alongside the biscuit malts and leaving a languid
  acidity with little aeration. Thin for a stout but pleasant addition to the Tuck
  porter. 1/03/22 not tasted in 7 years. Dark malt nose. Black body tan cream lace.
  Taste is more bitter than remembered but no cough syrup thankfully. Up two points.
