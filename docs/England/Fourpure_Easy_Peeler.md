| **Comments** | Poured clear pale yellow body and diminishing white lacing. Aroma has orange peel and grassy notes. Taste is medium sweet with more citric juiciness, some sourness in the transition, and a light bitter finish. Happily have a session. Palate is light to medium bodied slightly sticky texture with average carbonation and a crisp bitter finish. A good session beer for a summer afternoon moreish. |
