| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma muted in terms of spice and fruit but some malt. Appearance s copper with thin lace and some yeasty scum. Taste is sweet but more in a caramel than fruit way and thereâ€™s a lot of carbonation on the palate. This may have suffered by comparison with the excellent abbey ale that preceded it. |
