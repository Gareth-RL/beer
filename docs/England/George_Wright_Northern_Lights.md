Beer: George Wright Northern Lights
BeerID: 55545
Brewer: George Wright Brewing
City: St Helens
Comments: Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Pours honey amber with thin
  lace top. Aroma has tangerine pith hops and pale biscuit malt. Taste is medium sweet
  to sour with an edgy bitter finish that sharpens. Palate is medium bodied, average
  carbonation, oily texture, and a bitter astringent finish. Overall I am not sure
  it benefits from the ESB boost.
