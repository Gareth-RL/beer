| **Comments** | Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours golden with thin white lace foam top. Aroma has pale biscuity malts. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a crisp finish. A session pale for those who like a crisp drying finish. |
