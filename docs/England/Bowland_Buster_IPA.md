Beer: Bowland Buster IPA
BeerID: 335239
Brewer: Bowland Brewery
City: Clitheroe
Comments: A bit nondescript. Pours clear amber with white lace but there the promise
  diminished. Aroma muted malt and fruit hops. Taste is medium to bitter with a little
  hop berry in the finish. Palate is watery to light medium bodied, oily texture,
  average carbonation, and a light fruity biscuit malt finish. Given the world of
  IPA today this is a beer that time forgot and so will I.
