| **Comments** | Roasted malt on the nose. Thin tan head. Chestnut body. Given the Abv &#40;6.9&#41; and the preponderance of malts, I was expecting more: the fruits are there but fresh plum rather than dried raisin and the coffee and caramels that I was hoping to find never appeared. Still smooth and easy on the palate and that may be its strength and your weakness. |
