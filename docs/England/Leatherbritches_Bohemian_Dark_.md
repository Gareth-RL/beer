Comments: '"Roasted malt on the nose. Thin tan head. Chestnut body. Given the Abv
  &#40;6.9&#41; and the preponderance of malts, I was expecting more: the fruits are
  there but fresh plum rather than dried raisin and the coffee and caramels that I
  was hoping to find never appeared. Still smooth and easy on the palate and that
  may be its strength and your weakness."'
