| **Comments** | Tap at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. Aroma has a rich caramel malt block amidst a citrus hop fest. . Pours a murky marmalade orange with white lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to spicy with a definite tang. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and a spicy finish. The best I have had on my return from Italy. But could I drink a pint ? &#40;not these days&#41;. |
