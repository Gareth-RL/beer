| **Comments** | Aroma of dark malt--nutty, light roasted coffee. Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Medium sweet to bitter with plenty of malt flavour and a hint of autumn fruit. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish with a hint of licorice. A pleasant addition to the 2024 Trail at the Nags Head, East Leake  |
