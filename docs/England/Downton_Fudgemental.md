Beer: Downton Fudgemental
BeerID: 692415
Brewer: Downton Brewery
City: Salisbury
Comments: Aroma confirmed the fudge caramel brownie qualities. Poured dark reddish
  brown body with tan lace. Taste is medium sweet at the start but the bitter factor
  grows steadily to the finish. Palate is medium bodied at most slightly sticky feel
  average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Commended for avoiding excessive sweetness.
