Comments: '"@GoodfellowGeorge. Poured hazy golden body white lace top. Pale malt behind
  pine and lime scents. Medium sweet to bitter with a zesty citrus flavour and a pine
  resinous hop finish. Medium bodied soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  Very good for the abv. It contrasted tellingly with a Tiny Rebel pale I had immediately
  before."'
