City: Boughton
Comments: Malt and hops evident to the nose. Poured rich amber body with thin diminishing
  lacing. Taste is medium sweet with caramel malts detected. Palate is medium bodied
  sticky feel average carbonation and a light bitter finish. £2 a pint so I wish it
  was better.  Obviously it only suits the British palate.
