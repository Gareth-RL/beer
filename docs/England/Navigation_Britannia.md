Brewer: Navigation Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pour copper to chestnut with bubbly thin top. Aroma of plum and pear.
  Taste is similarly sweet malts with a persistence that masks the hops. If you like
  more balanced ales this may grate. Might also benefit from better carbonation. This
  has a flat finish. Not sure if Britannia will work more as a name but it’s solid
  enough for a session.
