| **Comments** | Cask. Pour copper to chestnut with bubbly thin top. Aroma of plum and pear. Taste is similarly sweet malts with a persistence that masks the hops. If you like more balanced ales this may grate. Might also benefit from better carbonation. This has a flat finish. Not sure if Britannia will work more as a name but itâ€™s solid enough for a session. |
