Comments: '"I''m a latecomer. It''s interesting to plot the ratings over time. Back
  on first release this was welcomed for its tangerine and grapefruit aroma. Pale
  malt citrus and straw flavours in a medium sweet to bitter transition. Light to
  medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Palate was
  solid enough. But whereas the pioneers welcomed a decent session IPA, later critics
  were unimpressed. I remain a beginner. Sampled at the Crafty teller which despite
  the name is mainly cocktails."'
