| **Comments**  | I'm a latecomer. It's interesting to plot the ratings over time. Back on first release this was welcomed for its tangerine and grapefruit aroma. Pale malt citrus and straw flavours in a medium sweet to bitter transition. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Palate was solid enough. But whereas the pioneers welcomed a decent session IPA, later critics were unimpressed. I remain a beginner. Sampled at the Crafty teller which despite the name is mainly cocktails.                                                                                      |
