| **Comments** | Tap @Junkyard Nottingham. Pours murky thin orange squash with bubble halo. Aroma has funky stew of something that loiters between stewed plum and apricot. Taste is acidic sour but never sharp. Palate is light to medium bodied with sticky texture soft carbonation and a languorous sour finish. Not really for me. |
