Beer: Castle Rock Sound & Vision
BeerID: 636616
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pours pale gold very clear body.white lace top. Aroma certainly has
  citra hops but I am unconvinced that the dry hopping was worth it. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium to watery body, oily feel I suppose and
  a bitter finish. Given the reliability of Harvest Pale, this seems an experiment
  that should inform the next rather than a n addition to the roster.
