| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale gold very clear body.white lace top. Aroma certainly has citra hops but I am unconvinced that the dry hopping was worth it. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium to watery body, oily feel I suppose and a bitter finish. Given the reliability of Harvest Pale, this seems an experiment that should inform the next rather than a n addition to the roster. |
