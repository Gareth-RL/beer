Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Stale bread aroma is not a promising start. Pours golden with an off
  white lace head diminishing. Taste is sour rather than bitter and fruity rather
  than malty but on a warm day it refreshes with a fairly classic soft finish.Not
  one of their best.
