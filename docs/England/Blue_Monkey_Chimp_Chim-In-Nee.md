Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask at the Organ Grinder. Golden body lace top. Aroma thin grassy and citrus
  hints. Watery mouthful with hoppy bitterness predominating over fruits. Some languorous
  acidity. Overall unremarkable. Infinity Bg Sips and Sanctuary are better in the
  range so no dancing on the roof tops.
