| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder. Golden body lace top. Aroma thin grassy and citrus hints. Watery mouthful with hoppy bitterness predominating over fruits. Some languorous acidity. Overall unremarkable. Infinity Bg Sips and Sanctuary are better in the range so no dancing on the roof tops. |
