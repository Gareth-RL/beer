| **Comments** | Can. Aroma sweet lemon and grapefruit zest. Pours yellow gold with fading white bubbly top. Taste has grapefruit pith and other pale citrus notes but there are roasted malt grainy and grassy notes as well. Its chief charm for me is its lightness and easy feel. A beer for the garden. |
