Brewer: Magic Rock Brewing (Odyssey Inns)
City: Huddersfield
Comments: Can. Aroma sweet lemon and grapefruit zest. Pours yellow gold with fading
  white bubbly top. Taste has grapefruit pith and other pale citrus notes but there
  are roasted malt grainy and grassy notes as well. Its chief charm for me is its
  lightness and easy feel. A beer for the garden.
