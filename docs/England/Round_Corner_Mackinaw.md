Comments: '"Poured chestnut body with off-white foam top. Aroma has dark malt and
  fruity notes. Some chocolate and light caramel. Taste is medium sweet to bitter
  with stronger fruit notes. Palate is medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish. In other times I would have taken a pint, now it''s a
  third."'
