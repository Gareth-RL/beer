| **Comments** | Cask. Pours chestnut brown with white cream top. Solid lacing. Aroma Satsuma and mango. Flavours in the taste are soft fruits at the fore with a growing hoppy bitterness in the tail. The palate is medium bodied with some slight soapy residue in the aftertaste. Not bad overall and certainly captures some American red characteristics. |
