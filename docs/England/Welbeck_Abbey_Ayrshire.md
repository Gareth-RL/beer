| **Comments** | Cask. No great scent but a little light spice and berry notes. Pours pale amber with white top and some lacing. Taste is medium body with a soft finish. There is some sweet malts but to call this&quot;jam-packed with flavour&quot; is unjustified in my view. So not a nag to bet on. |
