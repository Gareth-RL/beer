| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has none too subtle coffee notes. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and white foam top. Respectable lacing. Taste is medium bodied with well balanced sweet bitter balance and a soft finish. For a 3 5% it gives plenty of flavour. A solid mild. May it last. Meanwhile the beer menu carries the motto&quot;Carry whiskey in case of snakebite and furthermore always carry a small obedient snake .&quot; |
