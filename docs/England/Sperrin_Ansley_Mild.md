Beer: Sperrin Ansley Mild
BeerID: 290321
Brewer: Sperrin Brewery
City: Nuneaton
Comments: Cask. Aroma has none too subtle coffee notes. Pours dark chestnut with ruby
  lights and white foam top. Respectable lacing. Taste is medium bodied with well
  balanced sweet bitter balance and a soft finish. For a 3 5% it gives plenty of flavour.
  A solid mild. May it last. Meanwhile the beer menu carries the motto&quot;Carry
  whiskey in case of snakebite and furthermore always carry a small obedient snake
