BeerID: 97318
Brewer: Lymestone Brewery
City: Stone
Comments: Light aroma, grassy - some floral notes. White head and pale gold body.
  Tastes towards the melon and grapefruit end of the hoppy spectrum with an after
  taste that is sharper and more bitter than it is initially. Resinous and lacking
  body. Ironically it needs better foundations.
