| **Comments** | Nottingham Beer Festival. Aroma is cinnamon and chocolate notes did not notice vanilla. It pours dark chestnut body and a tan top. The taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied and sticky feel with average carbonation although softer at the festival I suspect, and a bitter finish. Overall a very pleasant flavoursome porter. |
