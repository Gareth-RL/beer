BeerID: 279818
Brewer: Red Cat Brewing
City: Winchester
Comments: Nottingham Beer Festival. Aroma is cinnamon and chocolate notes did not
  notice vanilla. It pours dark chestnut body and a tan top. The taste is medium bitter.
  Palate is medium bodied and sticky feel with average carbonation although softer
  at the festival I suspect, and a bitter finish. Overall a very pleasant flavoursome
  porter.
