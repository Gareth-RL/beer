Comments: '"@handandheart. Pours purple cloudy body with scummy lace top. Who&#39;d
  a thought we&#39;d be drinking purple beer. Aroma is fruity although I couldn&#39;t
  place it as blueberries without a prompt. Tart. Taste is lightly to medium sour.
  Palate is medium bodied, soft to average carbonation and a light sour finish. Oddly
  endearing."'
