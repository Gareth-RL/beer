| **Comments** | @handandheart. Pours purple cloudy body with scummy lace top. Who&#39;d a thought we&#39;d be drinking purple beer. Aroma is fruity although I couldn&#39;t place it as blueberries without a prompt. Tart. Taste is lightly to medium sour. Palate is medium bodied, soft to average carbonation and a light sour finish. Oddly endearing. |
