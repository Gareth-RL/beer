| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden yellow with definite white lace top. Aroma has floral bubblegum hops and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter biscuit finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a twiggy finish. Once many beers were like this only worse and called bitter. |
