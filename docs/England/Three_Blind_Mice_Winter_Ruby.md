| **Comments** | Dark fruits and malts in the scent. Poured cola with no head. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a pleasant fruitiness. I was expecting some caramel but its more date or fig. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel flat carbonation and a soft finish. Smooth but underwhelming. |
