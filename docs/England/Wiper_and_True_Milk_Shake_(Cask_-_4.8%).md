| **Comments** | So many batches. This one is 4.8%. milky coffee scent. Black body thin loose foam top. Medium sweet to bitter with lactic front and chocolate finish. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Unable to compare with earlier versions but good enough for me  |
