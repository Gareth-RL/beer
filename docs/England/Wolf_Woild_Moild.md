Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Wolf Woild Moild
BeerID: 5803
Brewer: Wolf Brewery (England)
City: Besthorpe
Comments: Cask. Aroma fruit vinegar malts. Appearance is dark ruby with tan lacing.
  It tastes better than it smells with dark fruits and roasted malts dominant to produce
  a medium sweet ale with a soft finish. Carbonation is light to flat and there is
  a slightly oily finish on the palate. Perfectly adequate in a world where adequate
  is not enough.
