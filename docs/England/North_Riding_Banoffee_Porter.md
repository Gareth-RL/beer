Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan lace top.  Heavy banana toffee scent obviously
  artificial but equally you know what you are getting.  Medium sweet with strong
  banana. The fakeness is more jarring in the taste. Medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a sugary finish.  Share a third with an enemy '
