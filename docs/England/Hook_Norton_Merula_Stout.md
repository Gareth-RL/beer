| **Comments** | Poured black body tan cream lace top. Chocolate coffee malt nose. Taste medium sweet to bitter with rapid transit to bitter as the hoppiness comes through the chocolate malt. Light to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Looks better than it smells or tastes. For those who prefer bitter stout. |
