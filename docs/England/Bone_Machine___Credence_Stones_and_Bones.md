Beer: Bone Machine / Credence Stones and Bones
BeerID: 602156
Brewer: Bone Machine Brew Co
City: Hull
Comments: Tap. Pours clear golden amber body thin lace halo. Aroma herbal medicinal
  hops so pine rather than pineapple rocket salad rather than peach. What fruit is
  there is stewed. Taste is medium sweet to light sourness. And a little alcohol evident.
  Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation, and a long
  souring finish. But the sweetness persists. So the jury is out for me on Bone Machine
  as I have had two collaboration beers this session and neither has excelled.
