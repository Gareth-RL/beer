Comments: Tap. Aroma is described as grassy/floral. With my nose it might be straw.
  Golden colour and clear. I get the’defined malty quality’ which may equate to a
  dunked biscuit. Similarly citrus flavor seems to mean grapefruit. But this is being
  less than generous. I have known barbecues that cried out for a session pale of
  precisely this description. So light a fire.
