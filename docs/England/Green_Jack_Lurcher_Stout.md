| **Comments** | Cask at the Company Inn. Pours dark brown and not black, full foam tan top. Aroma has dark fruit, chocolate and coffee malts.  Taste is medium bodied, milky rather creamy texture, carbonation average to soft, and a  sweet finish. Perfectly decent stuff like a club singer if you have never heard Sinatra. My head has been turned by impies and other beasts of the craft. 18/03/2024 six years later and I am kinder. The aroma is decent and I am used to stouts being medium body at most.
