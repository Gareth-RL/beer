Comments: '"Tap. Pours amber gold with white lace circle. Aroma has citrus, herbs,
  grass, hay, although the malts are more in the mouth. Taste is medium sweet to sour.
  Palate medium body, slick feel, average carbonation, bitter in the finish. I&#39;ve
  still not made up my mind on single hop beers. Innate limits I suspect."'
