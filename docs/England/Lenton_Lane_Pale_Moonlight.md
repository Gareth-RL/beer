| **Comments** | Clear golden body with white lace top. Aroma is light sweet with pale malts lurking. Taste is lightly bitter to sour. Palate is light soft carbonation but oddly the feel shifts from watery to sticky at the finish. Classed as a session pale with 3.7 abv it begs the question - would you like an evening in its company? Only reluctantly. |
