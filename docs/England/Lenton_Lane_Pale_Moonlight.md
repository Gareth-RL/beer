Beer: Lenton Lane Pale Moonlight
BeerID: 773996
Brewer: Lenton Lane Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Clear golden body with white lace top. Aroma is light sweet with pale malts
  lurking. Taste is lightly bitter to sour. Palate is light soft carbonation but oddly
  the feel shifts from watery to sticky at the finish. Classed as a session pale with
  3.7 abv it begs the question - would you like an evening in its company? Only reluctantly.
