Comments: Poured black body deep tan halo. Aroma of piney hops and dark malts.  Innocent that I am,  I am still surprised when a dark beer is hoppy. For me with sweet malt note comes late and is sandwiched by hops. Ultimately that adds to the hops' complexities. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  One of the best Cascadian darks I have had.
