Beer: Northern Whisper Chinwag
BeerID: 577795
Brewer: Northern Whisper Brewing Co.
City: Cloughfold
Comments: Tap. Pours hazy yellow with spotted broken white lacing. Aroma has pine,
  floral hops and some citrus. So hoppy. Taste is balanced medium sweet and bitter
  with bitter winning. Palate is medium bodied at most, oily feel, average to soft
  carbonation, and crisp finish. So ship it to the colonies I whisper.
