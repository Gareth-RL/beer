| **Comments** | Tap. Pours hazy yellow with spotted broken white lacing. Aroma has pine, floral hops and some citrus. So hoppy. Taste is balanced medium sweet and bitter with bitter winning. Palate is medium bodied at most, oily feel, average to soft carbonation, and crisp finish. So ship it to the colonies I whisper. |
