Comments: To hell with Aquinas’s ontological argument this is the only proof of God
  one needs. Aroma like rich loam. Colour dark in shadow ruby in the light with lace.
  Palate full and complex. I do not like damsons but they taste heat here. If it has
  a fault it’s being too strong and hefty for a lightweight like me. If this were
  mother’s milk there is none of us would be weaned.
