Beer: Lincoln Green Tub Thumper
BeerID: 1229212
Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: The molasses outwhiff the tonka in the scent. Poured dark rich chestnut
  body thin lace top.  Medium sweet to bitter with tonka making a strong comeback.
  Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish.  The
  8%abv is well managed. Not sure the oat milk helps.
