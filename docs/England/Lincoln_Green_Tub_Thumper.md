| **Comments**  | The molasses outwhiff the tonka in the scent. Poured dark rich chestnut body thin lace top.  Medium sweet to bitter with tonka making a strong comeback. Medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter finish.  The 8%abv is well managed. Not sure the oat milk helps.                                                                                      |
