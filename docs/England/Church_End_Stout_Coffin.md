| **Comments** | @nottingham beer festival. Aroma is butterscotch, caramel, malts. Appearance is dark body with off white lacing. Taste is medium heavy sweetness, then medium bitter. Palate is full and rich with soft carbonation and a creamy finish. I liked it and if it were not for the fact that it was shared with a friend, I would have drank far more&#033; |
