| **Comments** | Pours black tan cream top. Aroma is emphatically peanut butter. You get less scent opening a jar of the stuff. Taste is medium to full sweet with little diminution of the creamy peanut butter. This is better than Rees pieces. Texture is medium to full bodied smooth but with a grainy finish. I guess I would have liked a better cream head and some complexity but simply judged as peanut stout excellent. |
