Comments: '"Aroma has fruit, obscure ones like guava or papaya or lychee (actually
  scratch the last). Pours clear golden white lace (if a beer can appear self confident,
  this one does). Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied
  oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I wish a better beer had taken
  the name a perfect bliss point would be a thing to return to. As it  is, consider
  this fantastic scene. Pub. Northern England, men drinking. One says it''s alright,
  this, but where''s the guava?"'
