| **Comments** | Aroma has fruit, obscure ones like guava or papaya or lychee (actually scratch the last). Pours clear golden white lace (if a beer can appear self confident, this one does). Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I wish a better beer had taken the name a perfect bliss point would be a thing to return to. As it  is, consider this fantastic scene. Pub. Northern England, men drinking. One says it's alright, this, but where's the guava? |
