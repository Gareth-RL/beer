| **Comments** | Cask. Pours yellow with thin bubbly froth top. Aroma is an interesting mixture of caramel and peach. Taste is also more complex than you would expect with the roasted malts and hop fruits blending like toffee with raisins. I had watched as others made this the most popular beer in the micro-pub and ignored it as I prefer dark beer and hate Truman Capote. My loss. Highly recommended session bitter. |
