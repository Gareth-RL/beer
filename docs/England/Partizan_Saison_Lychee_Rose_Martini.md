| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden pale yellow with bubbly halo of lace that lasts. Aroma is floral with rose notes. Taste is medium to light sweet and medium bitter. Initial smack of bubble gum which maybe my uncouth palate struggling to identify lychee. Palate is medium, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a lingering finish. A Saison seems right on an April day that may prove to be the English summer. |
