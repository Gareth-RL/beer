BeerID: 523228
Brewer: Partizan Brewing
City: Market Harborough
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours golden pale yellow with bubbly halo of lace that
  lasts. Aroma is floral with rose notes. Taste is medium to light sweet and medium
  bitter. Initial smack of bubble gum which maybe my uncouth palate struggling to
  identify lychee. Palate is medium, sticky texture, soft carbonation, and a lingering
  finish. A Saison seems right on an April day that may prove to be the English summer.
