Beer: Flipside Clippings IPA
BeerID: 159825
Brewer: Flipside Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: A golden ale with a good creamy head. The aroma of hops and fruit is delicate
  rather than overpowering. Taste is nicely balanced and it stays on the palate with
  a pleasing strength. The second taste is better than the first. May reward better
  cellar work.
