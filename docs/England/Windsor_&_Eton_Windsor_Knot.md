| **Comments** | Cask at The Company Inn. Pours amber body with white lace top. Aroma has pale malts and hop berry fruits. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is oily, medium bodied, average carbonation, with an acrid finish. Pump clip had Harry and Meghan reference but I tried not to hold this against the beer in question. |
