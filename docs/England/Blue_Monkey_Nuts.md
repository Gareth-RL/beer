Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Roasted malt nose. Pours mahogany dark with bubbly tan top. Taste
  has hints of licorice and yes, nuts. Medium bodied with a soft finish. Overall,
  better than many in the flavour department and I wish it was around more. There’s
  only so much pale golden ale one can stomach.
