| **Comments** | Cask. Roasted malt nose. Pours mahogany dark with bubbly tan top. Taste has hints of licorice and yes, nuts. Medium bodied with a soft finish. Overall, better than many in the flavour department and I wish it was around more. Thereâ€™s only so much pale golden ale one can stomach. |
