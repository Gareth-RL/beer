| **Comments**  | Poured hazy golden body white lace top.  Aroma of citrus and pineapple. Medium sweet to bitter with juicy citrus notes and a pithy finish.  Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Neon Raptor is the best of Nottingham brewers at the moment so their collaboration intrigued me.  A decent cask offering but toned down from their own NEIPA offerings.                                                                                       |
