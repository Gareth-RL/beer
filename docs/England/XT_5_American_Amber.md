| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John. Aroma of bread with some fruit and grassy notes. Pours amber with thin top that laces strongly. Tastes biscuit malt with grapefruit rind. The fruit lingers on the palate. Not a lt of hoppy pay-off for an abv of 5.5%. Iâ€™m starting to prefer the pales with richer fruit aroma and tastes. So this is so-so. |
