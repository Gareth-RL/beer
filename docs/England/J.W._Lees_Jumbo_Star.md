Beer: J.W. Lees Jumbo Star
BeerID: 5653
Brewer: J.W. Lees
City: Middleton
Comments: Cask. Aroma has biscuit malt and hedge fruits. Pours copper with ruby notes,
  white top and persistent lacing. While there is a fruity sweetness initially the
  dominant elements are bitter hops that build to a crisp finish on the palate. A
  good example of a session bitter.
