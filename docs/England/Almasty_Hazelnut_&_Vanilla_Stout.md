| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours a murky brown with fleeting tan lace halo. Aroma has roasted vanilla malts and the hazelnut is evident in the taste. Taste itself is medium sweet to lightly bitter with almost a berry note. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a hazelnut finish. Despite delivering the flavours on the tin, this is missing something. |
