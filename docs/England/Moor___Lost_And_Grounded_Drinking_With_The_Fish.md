| **Comments** | Keg at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours deep orange gold with white lace top. Aroma has orange peel funk and wheat germ. Yeasty with hints of banana. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, slightly fizzy carbonation and a sour finish. An interesting if far from easy drinking Saison. |
