| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Aroma of chocolate caramel fudge. Medium sweet with milky chocolate and caramel to begin and coffee malt to finish. Rich. Medium to full bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It delivers but I can't imagine having a second Lion@Basford. 09/08/24 and lo a second sipping this time at Partizan   |
