| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma modestly hoppy. Pours golden with thin white lacing. The balance of hops and malt is almost too good and itâ€™s only in the languor that the hops win. In an age of super hopped citrus rich ales, this is a throwback as its name suggests. Like a lot of L G it is solid rather than splendid. |
