Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Cask. Aroma modestly hoppy. Pours golden with thin white lacing. The balance
  of hops and malt is almost too good and it’s only in the languor that the hops win.
  In an age of super hopped citrus rich ales, this is a throwback as its name suggests.
  Like a lot of L G it is solid rather than splendid.
