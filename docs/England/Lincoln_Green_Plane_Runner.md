| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden body white lace top with yeast spots. Aroma of citrus hops pale malts and yeast esters. Medium sweet to bitter with pleasant malt input. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not sure where the Norwegian farmhouse ale quality kicks in. But it's fine. |
