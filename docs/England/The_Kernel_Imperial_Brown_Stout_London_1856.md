Brewer: The Kernel Brewery

Comments: Tap. Pours dark chocolate body brown tan cream top. Aroma has caramel, coffee,
  chocolate, raisin, and a touch of spice. Taste is medium sweet with light sour alcohol
  finish. Palate is medium body, thick feel, soft carbonation, long finish, imperious
  as well as imperial. Abv does indeed vary. Mine was 9.9% so even better when shared.
  Second sipping 04/11/19 Bottle Pours black with creamy top and the rich aroma and
  taste stays the same. So what would make it a 4; maybe less alcohol in the taste
  more chocolate since I like it; even creamier texture. It is still a very fine ale.
