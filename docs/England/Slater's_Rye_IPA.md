Brewer: '"Slater&#39;s Ales"'
City: Stafford
Comments: Cask. Aroma bread dough with a hint of pineapples. Pours amber with white
  top. Fruity soft taste with the pure malt flavours immersed in a sweet wash. This
  also leaves a slight bubble gum aftertaste. For lovers of American rye this will
  disappoint rather than surprise. But it may bemuse the novice.
