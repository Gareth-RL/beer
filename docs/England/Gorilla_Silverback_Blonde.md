Beer: Gorilla Silverback Blonde
BeerID: 871742
Brewer: Gorilla Brewing (Mad Ape Ales)
City: Mexborough
Comments: Orange golden body thin diminishing lace top. Light citrus hop scent. Medium
  sweet to bitter with the hop flavours largely subordinate to the Marish Otter malt.
  Medium bodied, slightly grainy texture, mouth coating, average carbonation, and
  a long bitter finish. Bottle from brewery, and a golden ale that would be a safe
  session choice.
