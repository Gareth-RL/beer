Beer: '"Tom Wood''s Old Timber"'
BeerID: 271
Brewer: '"Lincolnshire Craft Beers (prev Tom Wood&#39;s)"'
City: Barnetby
Comments: Cask. Aroma nutty earthy malts. Pours an attractive copper with white lace
  wash. Taste has some toasted malts with a spicy nutty hop finish. On the board as
  a brown ale rather than a bitter but I suspect the cognoscenti would affirm its
  Bitter status. In that sense it looks good and lingers well.
