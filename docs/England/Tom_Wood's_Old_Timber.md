| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma nutty earthy malts. Pours an attractive copper with white lace wash. Taste has some toasted malts with a spicy nutty hop finish. On the board as a brown ale rather than a bitter but I suspect the cognoscenti would affirm its Bitter status. In that sense it looks good and lingers well. |
