| **Comments** | Cask. Pours chestnut with off white lace top. Aroma has herbal notes suitable for a juniper mild. Taste is medium bitter but with a tangle of surrounding flavours that others can unpack better than I. Palate is medium bodied, texture sticky, carbonation average, and the finish long. I&#39;m assuming Watts did not belong to the teetotal suffragist wing that may have slowed the achievement of female suffrage. |
