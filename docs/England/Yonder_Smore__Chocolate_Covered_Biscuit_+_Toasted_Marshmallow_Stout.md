Comments: Too much of a good thing. Aroma of chocolate coffee marshmallows and fruit. Poured black body tan thin lace diminishing to halo. Full sweet as the marshmallow and milk chocolate blend dominantly. Slow transition to a slightly dusty dark chocolate finish. Medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. I should have guessed how sweet it would be and at least that conceals the abv. But it's too much for me these days
