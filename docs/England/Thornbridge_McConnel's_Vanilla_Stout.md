| **Comments** | Aroma is more vanilla and coffee than chocolate, although others detect it. A black ale with little top to speak of. But some lace persists. Festival ales from barrel tap have a flatness which may accentuate what might be there anyway. For a vanilla stout this tastes pleasantly balanced with the roast malts holding their own. This even allows a nutty quality to creep in at the back edge of the palate. Overall better than most which is high praise for a man who is more bitter/porter/mild than stout inclined. And good to se Thornbridge doing rather than relying on the pale profits. |
