Beer: '"Thornbridge McConnel''s Vanilla Stout"'
BeerID: 69220
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Aroma is more vanilla and coffee than chocolate, although others detect
  it. A black ale with little top to speak of. But some lace persists. Festival ales
  from barrel tap have a flatness which may accentuate what might be there anyway.
  For a vanilla stout this tastes pleasantly balanced with the roast malts holding
  their own. This even allows a nutty quality to creep in at the back edge of the
  palate. Overall better than most which is high praise for a man who is more bitter/porter/mild
  than stout inclined. And good to se Thornbridge doing rather than relying on the
  pale profits.
