| **Comments** | Cask interesting aroma for a dark floral and sweetened coffee. Expresso black with crema to match. Taste is very smooth, continuing the toffee malt theme with some smokiness creeping through. Iâ€™d still describe the body as light to medium despite a creamy languor with a long finish and little carbonation. A pleasant surprise &#40;or just a sign that I should go home&#41;. |
