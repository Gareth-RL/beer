| **Comments** | Aroma is roasted malts predominantly with some berry hops.  Pours dark amber with off white lace. Taste is medium bitter predominantly but good for me abv. I associate ruby mild with higher abv. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Baffled by the American in the title unless it alludes to the hop choice. American mild is less likely than American porter. |
