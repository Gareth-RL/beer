Comments: '"Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pour very hazy orange &#40;more APA than
  IPA&#41;. Aroma has herbal toffee notes amidst the fruit. Taste is medium sweet
  to sour /bitter. Mainly sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average to
  soft carbonation, and a sour finish. Overall it was a good but flawed IPA and Buxton
  can do better."'
