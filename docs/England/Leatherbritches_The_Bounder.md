| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale clear orange gold with thin white lace. Aroma lightly herbal hops. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Amazed that I have not reviewed it before as it was my regular bitter at the Crown Beeston a few years back. Solid if unspectacular. |
