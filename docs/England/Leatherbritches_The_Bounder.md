Brewer: Leatherbritches Brewery
City: Ashby De La Zouch
Comments: Cask. Pours pale clear orange gold with thin white lace. Aroma lightly herbal
  hops. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. Amazed that I have not reviewed it before as it was my regular
  bitter at the Crown Beeston a few years back. Solid if unspectacular.
