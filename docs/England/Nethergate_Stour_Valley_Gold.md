| **Comments** | Cask. There’s a yeasty funk lurking but innocently. Pours a dark gold body and barely a white bubble worth the popping. The taste is stratified. First sip is muted malts, the second muted hops and the last is bitter with a lingering fruity sweetness below a building bitterness. More interesting to review than drink. |
