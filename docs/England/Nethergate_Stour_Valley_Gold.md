Beer: Nethergate Stour Valley Gold
BeerID: 300148
Brewer: Nethergate Brewery
City: Long Melford
Comments: Cask. There’s a yeasty funk lurking but innocently. Pours a dark gold body
  and barely a white bubble worth the popping. The taste is stratified. First sip
  is muted malts, the second muted hops and the last is bitter with a lingering fruity
  sweetness below a building bitterness. More interesting to review than drink.
