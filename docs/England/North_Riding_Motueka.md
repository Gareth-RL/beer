Brewer: North Riding Brewery
City: Snainton
Comments: Light grassy citrus aroma. Poured clear golden body lace halo. Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter with a hint of gooseberry. Palate medium to thin body smooth
  texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Like so many single hop ales, in
  my opinion, it lacks something.
