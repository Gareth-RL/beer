Comments: Tap at the Crafty Crow Nottingham. I may never Chriso again. He said this
  was a summer thirst quencher that did what it claimed (but it was 13 years ago).
  Anyway it pours murky gold with white lacing and smells of citrus hop and roasted
  malts. It tastes medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. Not sure my younger self would have forked out
  £5.10 for a pint (but enough about my years of destitution before fame and fortune
  drove me to drink) 09/07/19 second sipping and much cheaper.  Aroma is still underwhelming
  but the rest is okay in terms of the command get me a cold beer kinda way.
