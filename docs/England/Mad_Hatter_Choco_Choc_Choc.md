Comments: Tap at The Keans Head Nottingham. Pours black with tan top. Aroma has a
  little bitter chocolate whereas the flavour is sweet. Taste is medium bitter with
  a sweet start and finish. Palate is medium bodied, slick texture, average carbonation
  and a light sweet finish. I hoped for more.
