| **Comments** | Trouble is Neapolitan Ice Cream was not a beer. Aroma is a collision of strawberry extract, vanilla and chocolate malt. Not a hop of a chance. Poured a black body with a decent tan head. It's best feature. The strawberry rules upfront and that sweet fruit never fully dies with vanilla to back it up. Transition is the wrong term but eventually there's a moment of chocolate, milky but there. Medium bodied slightly sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Not the first Neapolitan beer I have tried, but a cautionary one. |
