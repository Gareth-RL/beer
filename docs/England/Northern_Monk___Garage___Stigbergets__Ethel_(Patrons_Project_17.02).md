Comments: '"Craft beer has introduced me to papaya. That''s not mango you are smelling
  but papaya. A cloudy orange fruit juice of a beer. Taste is the upper edges of medium
  sweet which lessens but never dies. There is a sour and bitter note in there but
  it''s very polite. Palate is similarly high up the medium bodied scale with clammy
  feel soft to average carbonation and a long finish. Perhaps the finest compliment
  is that it made me consider again whether I could date an Ethel."'
