Comments: '"Tap at The Brew Dog Nottingham. Pours hazy pale orange with white lacing
  halo. Aroma has the proverbial citric hops. Plus pineapple and lychee. Taste is
  medium to sour. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation,
  long finish with some souring. Overall another good beer that will never be great
  &#40;and woe betides anyone that applies this rule to humans&#033;&#41;"'
