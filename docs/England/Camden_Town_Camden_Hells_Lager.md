| **Comments** | Bottle. Pours pale golden clear body with white bubbly top that fades rapidly. Aroma has hay, grass, herbs, but lightly and the same applies to taste. Lightly sweet, bitter and sour. If lager is intended to be bland and unremarkable then this is a triumph. 27//12019 second sipping with lager drinkers who were more generous as to aroma and palate and it was better than the glass before it! |
