Comments: '"It won''t win you with the scent but then again it''s a generic disadvantage
  of English bitter that it lags aromatically behind the pales. Pours a good amber
  body with sheet lacing. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter with something
  quirky In the finish like the residue of toothpaste. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average carbonation and a quirky finish. I prefer my Blondie in corporeal
  form, but it''s decent."'
