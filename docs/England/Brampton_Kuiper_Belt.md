Comments: '"Poured copper body thin diminishing lace top (blink and you miss it--in
  the bottle version that is). Aroma has fruit whether it is stewed plum or stewed
  blackberry is not certain but it is certainly not the fresh kind. Medium sweet with
  more of the said fruit and not at all like the golden ale I had expected (is now
  the moment to check the bbd?[phew! Aug 2024). It''s palatable albeit on a single
  track that has hardly any transition--the finish is a stop rather than a languor.
  Medium bodied, smooth texture, soft carbonation even in the bottle and a fruitiness
  that persists. It is supposed to have Comet hops that are associated with grapefruit
  and this only has a bitterness in the aftertaste whereas most grapefruity hops give
  a pithiness after transition from the initial sweetness. So it''s all very mysterious.
  As a golden blonde ale, it is an eccentric--mine was copper coloured. More stewed
  fruit than pithy citrus in both scent and taste and surprisingly soft in the mouth.
  Having said all that it tastes pretty good and unless I discover I have been poisoned,
  I will boost the score."'
