| **Comments** | Cask. Pours pale yellow gold with white foam top. Aroma is sweet almost marshmallows. Floral notes and pale malt. Soft viscous finish. In two minds as this is pleasant enough and from close to the birthplace but it represents most of what I avoid in beer. So the rating signals my objectivity and attempt to be a better person.&#40;Cue the rising strings&#41;. |
