Aroma: 7.0

Taste: 7.0
Palate: 3.0
Overall: 12.0
MyScore: 3.3
Comments: Not subtle in the best pastry stout tradition.  Aroma of candy sugar and chocolate malts.  Medium sweet to lightly bitter but with some returning sweetness in the finish.  Palate is an issue as it has a thin feel for a stout offset by a sticky sweet finish.  They can, and do, do better.
