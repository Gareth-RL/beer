| **Comments** | A meh nose that gestures vaguely towards hops and malt without choosing.  Certainly golden with white sheet lace. Taste is similarly balanced to a nullity. Palate aspires to medium bodied, oily I suppose, below average carbonation, and a fade rather than a finish. Profoundly uninspired. |
