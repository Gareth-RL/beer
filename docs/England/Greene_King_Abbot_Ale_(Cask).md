Comments: '"Cask. Malt and dried fruit. Brown to copper in colour with thin top. There
  was a time when this was special because so little else was even passable. There
  was a time when its smooth blending and balancing of hops and malts was enough.
  I still find more to savour here than in some over-hopped craft ale. It will keep
  its pace. But it’s also a marker of all that has changed. Pre-revolutionary. Vive
  la revolution&#033;"'
