| **Comments** | Cask. Malt and dried fruit. Brown to copper in colour with thin top. There was a time when this was special because so little else was even passable. There was a time when its smooth blending and balancing of hops and malts was enough. I still find more to savour here than in some over-hopped craft ale. It will keep its pace. But it’s also a marker of all that has changed. Pre-revolutionary. Vive la revolution&#033; |
