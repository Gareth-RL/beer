Brewer: Big Penny Beer
City: Walthamstow
Comments: Cask. Cascade hops offer scent. Seatz hops make it golden. It’s mellow and
  session-able, but why in an age of variety unless you can’t be bothered. Obviously
  outside the M25 we have prejudices against spending the best part of a fiver on
  something that is £3 elsewhere and dull.
