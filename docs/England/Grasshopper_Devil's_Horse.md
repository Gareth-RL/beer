| **Comments** | Poured dark body with tan cream lace. Aroma has coffee and other dark malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with milk coffee giving way to a licorice backnote; interesting. Palate is medium bodied at most, smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. I would not swear to its Irish credentials but it's a decent stout all the same. |
