Comments: '"Poured dark body with tan cream lace. Aroma has coffee and other dark
  malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with milk coffee giving way to a licorice
  backnote; interesting. Palate is medium bodied at most, smooth texture soft to average
  carbonation and a bitter finish. I would not swear to its Irish credentials but
  it''s a decent stout all the same."'
