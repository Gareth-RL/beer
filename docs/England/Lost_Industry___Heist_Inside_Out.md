Beer: Lost Industry / Heist Inside Out
BeerID: 704365
Brewer: Lost Industry Brewing
City: Sheffield
Comments: Aroma has raspberry yoghurt properties. Pours hazy pink with thin lace.
  Taste is medium sour cream with background sweetness. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel soft to average carbonation and a long lactose finish. Does what it says. Someone
  (not me) should track the sales of hose as a measure of craft beer market penetratio.
  Cask would not have done this.
