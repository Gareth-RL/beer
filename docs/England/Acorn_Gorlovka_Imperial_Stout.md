| **Comments** | Cas. Malty with a whiff of gravy powder on the nose. Dark as befits an imperial stout but the tan top could be improved in terms of creamy texture. Taste has smooth roasted malt with a little fruit flitting through.and some coffee notes in the finish. Imperial stout is not an easy style to master. I have yet to find my archetype but this isnâ€™t it. |
