Beer: Animal Hare
BeerID: 385053
Brewer: XT Brewing
City: Long Crendon
Comments: Cask. Aroma of roasted malts. Pours reddish copper with thin top that still
  yields some lacing. The hops come through more than the rye in the taste with berry
  fruits and a dry finish. No great spice in the taste. Palate is thin bodied with
  a resinous aftertaste. Overall a solid rather than spectacular brew.
