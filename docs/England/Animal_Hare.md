| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of roasted malts. Pours reddish copper with thin top that still yields some lacing. The hops come through more than the rye in the taste with berry fruits and a dry finish. No great spice in the taste. Palate is thin bodied with a resinous aftertaste. Overall a solid rather than spectacular brew. |
