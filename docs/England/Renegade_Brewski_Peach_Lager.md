Comments: Another surprise at the Organ Grinder - a lager I quite like. Hazy golden
  body spotty lacing. Aroma signals the peach. Taste is medium sweet to sweet, not
  much of a transition to anything else. If anything the sweetness grows. Medium bodied
  smooth texture average carbonation and a clammy sticky finish. The above may signal
  how much I dislike lager, but I can imagine a beach holiday where this is the Go
  -to beer.
