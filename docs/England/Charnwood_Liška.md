Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Charnwood Liška
BeerID: 319056
Brewer: Charnwood Brewery
City: Loughborough
Comments: poured clear golden with extravagant white foam top and visible aeration
  in the glass. Aroma is bready malts with a background note of lemon hops. Taste
  is medium sweet to bitter with the later having a bit of an aspirin tang. I note
  that this is not regarded as a lager however the brewer labels it and that it is
  listed as spring seasonal and I am drinking a bottle recently bought in November.
  The palate is certainly not lager like. Medium bodied, oily, high carbonation and
  the said odd finish. Given that others refer to soft carbonation and a semi drying
  close, it seems to vary in the bottle. Other Charnwood ales have been better.
