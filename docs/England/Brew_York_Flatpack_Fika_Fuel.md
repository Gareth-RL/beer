| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee caramel and soft berry fruit. Pours black bodied with tan lace. Taste is a medium sweet sandwich sweet to start bitter middle and marzipan towards the finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft carbonation and bittersweet tonka finish. Overall quite bitter for a dessert style imperial. |
