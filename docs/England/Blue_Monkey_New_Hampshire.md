| **Comments** | Poured cloudy golden body white lace top. Aroma peach and tropical fruit. Medium sweet to bitter. Lemony pineapple front load and souring grapefruit notes to finish. Juicy. Medium bodied slightly grainy above average carbonation and a mineral chalky finish that's the curse of the NEIPA  At least BM have joined the throng on tap. |
