| **Comments** | You either gose or you don't. Pink purple with diminishing pink froth. Aroma has berries and watermelon. Taste is more blackcurrant than plum for me. Sour yes. Palate is medium bodied average to soft carbonation and a souring finish. In the words of the prophet, I'll get me coat! |
