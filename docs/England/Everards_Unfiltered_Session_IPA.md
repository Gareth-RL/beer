| **Comments** | Poured slightly hazy golden body white lace top. Aroma citrus hops and pale malt. Medium sweet to bitter with light grapefruit and melon and roasted malts in the crisp finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not bad although whether that's due to its being unfiltered is beyond me  |
