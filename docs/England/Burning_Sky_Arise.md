| **Comments** | Tap at The Junkyard Nottingham. Pours pale gold yellow with white foam top. Aroma is grassy hop and lemon. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a crisp finish. Overall this is what a session pale should taste like. Still wondering at the IPA moniker but very good  |
