Beer: Blue Monkey A Very British Ape
BeerID: 282186
Brewer: Blue Monkey Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pours copper brown with thin white lace top. Scent is more dried fruit
  than biscuity malty. But these blend well in the taste which is rich and varied
  like a good fruit pudding. The hops come through at the las to ensure a truly bitter
  languor. Very nice for St Georges Day.
