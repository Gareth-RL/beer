Beer: Black Iris Sore Arse Cheeks
BeerID: 547214
Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Pours cloudy yellow with white foam lace top. Aroma hoppy floral and
  citric. Taste dry hoppy, light sweetness medium sour and bitter finish. Medium body,
  sticky texture but with a crisp finish. Too early to assess accuracy of its name.
  But veterans still speak in awed terms of the laxative properties of Shipstones
  of distant memory.
