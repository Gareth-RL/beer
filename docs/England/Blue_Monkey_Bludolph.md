Comments: 'Cask at the Grinder to mark Christmas past. Muted citrus aroma by Blue
  Monkey standards. Honey gold with thin lace top. Tasted pleasingly of ripe soft
  fruit with some milder floral notes. Nothing to do with Christmas unless it’s global
  warming. Or an advert for summer. Underwhelming 12/11/23 second sipping slightly
