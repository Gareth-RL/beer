| **Comments** | Cask at the Grinder to mark Christmas past. Muted citrus aroma by Blue Monkey standards. Honey gold with thin lace top. Tasted pleasingly of ripe soft fruit with some milder floral notes. Nothing to do with Christmas unless itâ€™s global warming. Or an advert for summer. Underwhelming 12/11/23 second sipping slightly better  |
