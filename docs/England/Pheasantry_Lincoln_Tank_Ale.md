Comments: '"Poured clear copper body and thin scummy lace top. Bread malt and berry
  hop scent. Taste is light sweet and biscuit bitter with slightly dusty musty finish.
  It reminds me of many beers from the 1970s. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel,
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. It''s okay is the consensus but that''s
  the sum total of our excitement."'
