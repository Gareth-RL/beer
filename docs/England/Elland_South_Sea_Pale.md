| **Comments** | Cask at the Crown Inn Beeston . Pours amber gold body with white lace top. Aroma muted citrus hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Overall I could not spot it in a blind tasting that&#39;s for sure. |
