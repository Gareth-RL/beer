Beer: North Brewing Co Mystic Voyage
BeerID: 675957
Brewer: North Brewing Co (England)
City: Leeds
Comments: Pours black with tan cream halo. Aroma has peanut butter coffee and dark
  chocolate notes - all you would expect. Taste is medium full sweetness that softens
  to light bitterness with a slightly salty peanut edge. Palate is medium to full
  bodied smooth (dare I say buttery) texture, soft to average carbonation, and a salty
  long finish. Overall a very smooth peanut experience that will drive some people
  nuts. Apologies to the groaners out there. I feel your pain.
