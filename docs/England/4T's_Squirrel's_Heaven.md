| **Comments** | Aroma of coffee chocolate malts and peanut. Pours black with tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Could be smoother and fuller to convey peanut butter qualities to the stout. @Sir John Borlase Warren.  18/09/24 second sipping still a decent pastry stout that lacks the body to give it humph.  |
