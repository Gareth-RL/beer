| **Comments** | Summer fruit and citrus. Poured dark hazy gold body white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some citrus and mango notes but more stew than kick. Light chalk finish. Light to medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I won't seek it out  |
