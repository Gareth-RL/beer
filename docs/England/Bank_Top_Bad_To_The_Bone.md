| **Comments** | Cask. Modest hints of caramel malts on the nose. Pours amber gold with lace top. Reasonably hopped to balance in the taste. Little languor on a light palate. Soft finish. I can imagine a pleasant evening in a country pub with this as the session ale, but the sparkle would have to come from the conversation. |
