Beer: Bank Top Bad To The Bone
BeerID: 57936
Brewer: Bank Top Brewery
City: Bolton
Comments: Cask. Modest hints of caramel malts on the nose. Pours amber gold with lace
  top. Reasonably hopped to balance in the taste. Little languor on a light palate.
  Soft finish. I can imagine a pleasant evening in a country pub with this as the
  session ale, but the sparkle would have to come from the conversation.
