Beer: Totally Brewed Ekuanot Oatshake
BeerID: 703266
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Pours golden body white lace top. Aroma has crisp citrus and pale cereal
  notes. Taste is medium bitter with a little light sweetness amid a grapefruit mass.
  Body was medium, texture was oily rather than creamy and carbonation was soft to
  average. The can was well beyond BBE so I think some of the qualities had diminished
  (that will teach me!)
