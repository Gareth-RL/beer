Brewer: Bank Top Brewery
City: Bolton
Comments: Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden with white lace top. Aroma
  is a nice blend of citrus hop and roasted malts. Nicely balanced as they say in
  the trade. Taste is medium sweet to bitter thanks to the malts. Palate is medium
  bodied, sticky texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I think we have
  lost sight of how difficult a good bitter is to brew.
