Brewer: Cotleigh Brewery
City: Wiveliscombe
Comments: Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours golden. White top. Aroma is pale
  malts and berry fruit. The biscuit wins. Taste moves from neutral to light bitterness.
  Palate is light bodied, texture slick, carbonation soft to average, and the finish
  is abrupt. I guess this was a clandestine night operation where no one should know
  you have been...
