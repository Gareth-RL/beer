| **Comments** | Cask. The commercial de&#083;cription talks of floral, herbal aromas but for me the scent is more compost than garden. Colour is copper with lacing. Taste is more hops than malt giving the promised tart bitterness. Not my preferred aftertaste and donâ€™t spill it on any garment or friend you like. |
