Comments: '"Cask. The commercial de&#083;cription talks of floral, herbal aromas but
  for me the scent is more compost than garden. Colour is copper with lacing. Taste
  is more hops than malt giving the promised tart bitterness. Not my preferred aftertaste
  and don’t spill it on any garment or friend you like."'
