Beer: Track El Dorado Single Hop
BeerID: 501859
Brewer: Track Brewing Co.
City: Manchester
Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Slightly bewilderingly mine pours murky yellow gold
  with not a hint of amber or orange to be seen. Aroma has fruit  - tangerine citrus
  at a guess and possibly melon. Taste is medium bodied if light side thereof, texture
  is oily, carbonation average, and finish blah. I think single hop ales are hard
  to do well.
