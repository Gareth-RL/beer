| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Slightly bewilderingly mine pours murky yellow gold with not a hint of amber or orange to be seen. Aroma has fruit  - tangerine citrus at a guess and possibly melon. Taste is medium bodied if light side thereof, texture is oily, carbonation average, and finish blah. I think single hop ales are hard to do well. |
