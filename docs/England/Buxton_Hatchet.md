| **Comments** | Poured golden body white foam top.  Aroma of citrus and pine hops. Medium sweet to bitter . Rapid transition to a resinous bitter finish.  Medium bodied slightly dusty texture average carbonation and a drying bitter finish.   Safe enough, but nothing special. My 2nd Peak District purchase  |
