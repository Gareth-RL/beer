| **Comments** | A great beer to test your hop nose. I get melon and grapefruit and some floral notes but redcurrants eluded me. Poured clear golden body with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with pithy citrus notes. Palate is thin soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. But as a test case for spotting three hops excellent. |
