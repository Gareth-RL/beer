| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma caramel malts. Pours chestnut brown with cream white lace top. Taste is watery initially so a lighter mild with medium sour finish and fruit notes. Nit seen before and unlikely to displace the Major or the Big Ben. But it reminds me of old milds bought because they were cheaper than bitter. You could stay out longer for a pound&#033; |
