| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured dark brown with ruby lights and foamy tan cream top. Aroma has orange for sure amid the dark malts as well as smoke and some spice. The taste is bitter throughout but with some fruit and dark chocolate intruding along the way but for me the peaty bitter taste predominated. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Overall, the infusion of orange and coriander into a dark porter worked better than I expected, and the oak smoke was more evident too. Good stuff. |
