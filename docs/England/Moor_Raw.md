Beer: Moor Raw
BeerID: 125074
Brewer: Moor Beer Co.
City: Bristol
Comments: Cask. Pours hazy brown copper with off white lacing. Aroma has floral hops
  atop roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter once you get through initial sweetness
  and before the sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation,
  bitter sour finish. I liked this more initially but it became less remarkable as
  the glass thinned.
