| **Comments** | Cask. Pours hazy brown copper with off white lacing. Aroma has floral hops atop roasted malts. Taste is medium bitter once you get through initial sweetness and before the sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter sour finish. I liked this more initially but it became less remarkable as the glass thinned. |
