| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma has peach pineapple and lemon. Pours cloudy or hazy lemon gold. ( I instinctively mistrust hazy pales). Taste is medium bitter lightly sweet with a pleasant dry finish with floral notes. Overall it seemed a classic pale but my drinking companion was unimpressed and he knows his beer. Second sample 19/06/19 Still peachy, clearer golden and my mistrust has diminished. Lemony in flavour with enough sweetness to stop the pucker.  Without a discerning friend I am more generous. Third sample. Can at home. Slightly more bitter than I recall previously (then again,  aren't all?) |
