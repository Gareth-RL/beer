Comments: Th scent announces that chocolate peanut butter is here.  Poured black bodied
  with tan cream lace top. Taste is ultra sweet initially and it is hard for the counterpoint
  of bitterness to break through. This may explain why the carbonation is so high.
  Body is medium bodied and might be sticky but for the fizz. The finish remains toffee
  sweet. Despite a sensational scent this falls away. And a taster is enough.
