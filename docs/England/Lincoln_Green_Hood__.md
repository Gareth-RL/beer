| **Comments** | A pleasing surprise since classic bitter is not the style in vogue. Subtle soft sweet aroma. Dark chestnut body. Good lacing. Full bodied but balanced taste. With acid hop working well against earthy malts. The hops last on the palate. A solid reliable session bitter. Just what the world needs. |
