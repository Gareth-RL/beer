Comments: '"Cask. Pours dark brown with lace top. Aroma has mocha and the kind of
  hazelnut you can get Ina praline &#40;modestly so&#41;. Taste is the same mixture
  which may deter those who like the flavours to sit around a central malt base. This
  may be trying too hard. Maybe master the chocolate porter first. A fellow drinker
  said its appeal grew so this may just be a matter of first appearances."'
