Comments: 'Aroma of cherries dipped in chocolate and rolled in cocoa. Murky dark brown
  broken lacing. Taste is medium sweet but the cocoa pulls the bitterness through.
  Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Despite
  the truffle warning this was more chocolatey than I expected. '
