Comments: Tap at the Junkyard. Pours black coffee body and tan lace halo. Aroma muted
  cocoa and spice, the latter more evident in the mouth where the chili fizzes a little.
  Taste medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium body, oily feel, average carbonation,
  long finish, the spice certainly lingers more than the other elements.
