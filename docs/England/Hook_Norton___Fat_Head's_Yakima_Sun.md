Comments: If you want &quot;tropical fruit&quot; aroma in a beer this exemplifies
  - lychee, pineapples and grapefruit. Honey coloured on the darker end of that spectrum
  with gold highlights. Taste is predictable in some respects - sweet and fruity,
  but quite a lot of carbonation. The earthy malts and yeasty flavours struggle with
  the more bitter hoppy ones to form the background. Overall it’s better than its
  parts. One can fault the balance. It’s never going to please pale ale connoisseurs
  but dangerously drinkable. Just maybe alongside a spicy meal the bitter background
  would emerge. Anyway worth a pint.
