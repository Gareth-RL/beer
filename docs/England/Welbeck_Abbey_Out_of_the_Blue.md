| **Comments** | A fruity nose edging towards plum. Pours dark body and loose tan lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter, but with a decidedly stone fruit flavour. Is the whey a factor? Possibly hinted in the aroma. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long fruit finish. Certainly full flavoursome and character full. I liked it and so did others apparently mmmn |
