BeerID: 711663
Brewer: Welbeck Abbey Brewery
City: Welbeck
Comments: A fruity nose edging towards plum. Pours dark body and loose tan lacing.
  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter, but with a decidedly stone fruit flavour.
  Is the whey a factor? Possibly hinted in the aroma. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel average carbonation and a long fruit finish. Certainly full flavoursome and
  character full. I liked it and so did others apparently mmmn
