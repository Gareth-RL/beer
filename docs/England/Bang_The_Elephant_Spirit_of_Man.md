Comments: Dark malty nose. Poured cloudy dark brown with off white lace. Taste is
  medium sweet to bitter with a crisp dry quality that pleases. Palace is medium bodied
  oily texture average to full carbonation and a light bitter finish. Pleasant. I
  guess all my lager should be Dunkel. A brewer to watch.
