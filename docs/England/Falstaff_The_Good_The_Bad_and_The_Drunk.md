| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma stewed fruit with Demerara sugar. Pours ruby amber brown with thin scummy top. Taste has caramelized malts and lots of fruit. Texture is oily and coats the palate with a yeasty grainy after taste.I suspect this may be towards the barrel end. 28/01/20 Evidently elusive given the small number of reviews over the years. Still fruity in the scent and malty in the taste and grainy in the finish. Still odd, frankly and not delivering on its abv in terms of richness. But this sample was better than the last |
