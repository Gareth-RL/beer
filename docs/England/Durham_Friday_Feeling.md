Comments: Honey comb and dark chocolate stout @TheMistRollingInn. Poured ruby dark brown tan wash top. Candy and dark malt scent. Medium sweet with chocolate and caramel evident but it is not a Crunchie. Thin to medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. Okay as sweet stouts go, but don't go out of your way for it.
