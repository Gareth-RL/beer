Comments: '"Bottle from Adventure Beer. Poured black/dark brown body full tan foam
  top mainly lasting. Aroma has dark malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some
  light chocolate notes. Palate is medium bodied, watery texture, average carbonation
  and a light bitter finish. Overall a good example of oatmeal stout, but like my
  other recent ratings, it has been less noteworthy than I might have hoped. Maybe
  it''s the drinker not the drink!"'
