Comments: '"Tap at the Canal House. Pours ebony black body and foamy mocha to, diminishing
  lacing. Aroma profoundly dark roasted malts with licorice and dark chocolate notes.
  Taste is medium bitter with a little ashy aftertaste. Palate is medium bodied with
  sticky texture, average carbonation, and said bitter ashes in the finish although
  that is not as bad as it sounds&#033; Oddly enough this is listed as a foreign stout
  which may be a swipe at Derbyshire given that I am in Nottingham."'
