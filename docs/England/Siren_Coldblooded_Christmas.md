| **Comments**  | Poured brown body tan lace diminishes rapidly to halo. Aroma of chocolate and coffee grounds and nuts. Medium sweet to bitter more chocolate some coffee and a hint of spice. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Lots to enjoy and well blended                                                                                       |
