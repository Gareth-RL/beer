| **Comments** | Poured clear dark brown with little to no lace. Aroma is faint coffee malts. Taste is similar medium sweet some plum lightly bitter hint of liquorice. Palate is thin watery some stickiness in the finish average carbonation and a bitter finale, although light. Not sure what they were aiming for but not a porter to quest for. |
