| **Comments** | Aroma light citrus. Pours pale orange golden body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall this is a hard beer to judge since over the years it's impressed and underwhelmed the connoisseurs. It's decent enough but I would not spot it in a blind tasting. |
