| **Comments** | Poured black body tan lace top. Aroma coffee malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with swift transition as coffee grounds kick in. Certainly more bitter than sweet for a stout. Light to medium bodied slightly tacky after a smooth start, average carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent 22/02/24 a year later 2nd sipping. First was at the reopened Roundhouse and this one at the reopened Hand &Heart. Still decent  |
