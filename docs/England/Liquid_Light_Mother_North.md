| **Comments** | Pours a decidedly murky orange with a thin scummy top. Fortunately, the aroma is better with melon, apricot and pineapples detectable. Taste is dank and juicy with a medium sweet beginning and a sour vegetable finish. Palate is thin to medium bodied, slightly cloying with some pith in the finish, and a soft to average carbonation. It's fruity in the best NEIPA tradition but there are other notes in here that I could do without. |
