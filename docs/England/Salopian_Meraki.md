Brewer: Salopian Brewery

Comments: Cask at the Organ Grinder. Second surprise of the evening since typically
  the Salopian they get is hoppy. Pours dark brown to black body tan cream top. Aroma
  has chocolate malts vanilla and faint coconut. Taste is medium sweet with a  bitter
  chocolate finish. Lightly. Palate is medium to full, creamy texture, soft carbonation,
  and a bitter finish. A worthy stout.
