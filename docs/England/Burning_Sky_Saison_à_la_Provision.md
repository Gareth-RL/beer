Comments: Tap at the Canal House. Pours golden with white lace top diminishing. Aroma
  floral grassy hops with lactic back note. Taste is medium to full sourness. Palate
  is medium bodied, crisp and dry texture, soft to average carbonation, sour finish.
  A good Saison but also proof that it will never be my preferred style.
