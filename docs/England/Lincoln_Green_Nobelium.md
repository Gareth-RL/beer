Comments: '"Tap. Aroma emphatically yeasty. Pours yellow in the light and copper with
  the table top behind, an indication of its clearness. No top. The taste betrays
  the alcoholic kick with tangerine notes and an initial buzz of carbonation. This
  settles and the palate is light to medium. A highly commendable experiment - do
  more&#033;"'
