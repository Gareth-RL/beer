| **Comments** | Aroma of hazelnut and chocolate malts. Poured dark mahogany body with tan lace top. Taste is ultra sweet with plenty of Nutella. Light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied at most, smooth texture soft carbonation and light bitter finish. A dessert beer with less octane than the imperials. |
