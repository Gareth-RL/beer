Comments: '"Cask. Aroma bready, resinous and slightly spicy. Appearance is a rich
  ruby chestnut brown with thin off-white bubbly top that yields broken lacing. Taste
  is an odd mixture with the initial sweetness souring rapidly to quite an acrid finish.
  I just hope a doctor won’t be needed &#40;they bring me out in a rash.&#41;"'
