| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma bready, resinous and slightly spicy. Appearance is a rich ruby chestnut brown with thin off-white bubbly top that yields broken lacing. Taste is an odd mixture with the initial sweetness souring rapidly to quite an acrid finish. I just hope a doctor wonâ€™t be needed &#40;they bring me out in a rash.&#41; |
