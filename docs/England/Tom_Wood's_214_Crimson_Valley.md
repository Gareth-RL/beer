Brewer: '"Lincolnshire Craft Beers (prev Tom Wood&#39;s)"'
City: Barnetby
Comments: Cask. Aroma pine. Pours amber thin lacing and generally flat to soft. A
  sweet mash brew with an orange juice aftertaste. Suffers by comparison with those
  I have already encountered on the Hop. But if you want an easy drinking 5.5 this
  will suit.
