| **Comments** | Poured clear golden body thin lace top. Aroma pineapple grapefruit and citrus as you would expect from the hops on board. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a slight sour mineral finish. Palate is thin, average to soft carbonation and a chalky finish. Session worthy if you don't mind the finish. |
