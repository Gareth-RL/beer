| **Comments** | Poured copper body ruby lights scummy top. Aroma of caramel malt and a hint of pineapple. Medium sweet to bitter with a transition from sweet malt to sweet hop and then a bitter finish. I wanted to like this more than I did and just caught a licorice tang in the finish that pushed up the score  |
