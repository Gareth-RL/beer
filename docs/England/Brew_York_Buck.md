Comments: 'Poured copper body ruby lights scummy top. Aroma of caramel malt and a
  hint of pineapple. Medium sweet to bitter with a transition from sweet malt to sweet
  hop and then a bitter finish. I wanted to like this more than I did and just caught
  a licorice tang in the finish that pushed up the score '
