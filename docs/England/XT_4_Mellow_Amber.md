Comments: I even blew my nose before smelling this flagship beer, but it made little
  difference. Aroma has definite berry hops and light caramel malts. Pours pale clear
  amber body and thin lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but with more caramel
  malts than I expected. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. There was a time when my naive palate would have enthused,
  but privilege has killed my joy. Now I enjoy so many wonderful beers that I give
  enthusiasm sparingly. So this beer may deserve a better drinker.
