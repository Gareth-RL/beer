| **Comments** | Cask at The Organ Grinder Nottingham. Took a while to settle on a warm summer day but eventually pale golden body with white lace top. Aroma has the time honoured citric hops of an Oakham ale. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter but that intensifies. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, more than average carbonation but not unduly fizzy, and a bitter finish. My review was interrupted by a fellow drinker who reminisced that Green Devil had made him see things he did not want to see again &#40; he later conceded that it was not the only drink that evening&#41; but this is the kind of encounter that gives one pause. Anyway assuming I do not have vision, I recommend the beer. |
