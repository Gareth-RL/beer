| **Comments** | A pumpkin spice stout as the aroma confirms. Poured chestnut body tan lace top. Medium sweet to sour with a lot of pumpkin to the fore. Rather overwhelmed everything else. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a souring finish. A novelty and it may not enchant everyone  |
