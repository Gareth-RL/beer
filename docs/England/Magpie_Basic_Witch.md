Comments: 'A pumpkin spice stout as the aroma confirms. Poured chestnut body tan lace
  top. Medium sweet to sour with a lot of pumpkin to the fore. Rather overwhelmed
  everything else. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a souring
  finish. A novelty and it may not enchant everyone '
