| **Comments** | Keg. Formidable. Aroma has chocolate and coffee malts on the nose but in the mouth vanilla whisky and berry fruit lurk below. Pours dark with circle of tan lacing that breaks predictably. Taste is richly mellifluous with sweet and bitter notes playing with the palate like a kitten with a string. Carbonation soft to average. Body is medium to full and creamy with a long finish. Yum. A porter to carry with you. |
