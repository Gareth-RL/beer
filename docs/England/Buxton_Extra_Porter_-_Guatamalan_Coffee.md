Beer: Buxton Extra Porter - Guatamalan Coffee
BeerID: 409056
Brewer: Buxton Brewery
City: Buxton
Comments: Keg. Formidable. Aroma has chocolate and coffee malts on the nose but in
  the mouth vanilla whisky and berry fruit lurk below. Pours dark with circle of tan
  lacing that breaks predictably. Taste is richly mellifluous with sweet and bitter
  notes playing with the palate like a kitten with a string. Carbonation soft to average.
  Body is medium to full and creamy with a long finish. Yum. A porter to carry with
  you.
