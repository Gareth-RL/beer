| **Comments** | Poured dark brown body tan lace top. Aroma is primarily coffee malts with hazelnut and cocoa for a praline effect. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with plenty of praline and a nice coffee dusting in the finish. Medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Nice |
