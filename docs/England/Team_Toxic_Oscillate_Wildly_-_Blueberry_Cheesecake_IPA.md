Beer: Team Toxic Oscillate Wildly - Blueberry Cheesecake IPA
BeerID: 711432
Brewer: Team Toxic
City: Birkenhead
Comments: Pours hazy pink to purple body white lace halo. Aroma has blueberry and
  lactose which may promise cheesecake. Taste is medium sweet edging sour like yoghurt.
  Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a sour finish.
  It may suit some but not me, not now. I left it oscillating wildly.
