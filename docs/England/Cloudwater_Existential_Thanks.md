| **Comments** | Pours hazy to cloudy orange y with white lace top. Aroma has mango pineapple papaya and associates. Dank. Taste is medium sweet or more with a good transition to bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a long finish. An excellent fruity IPA. A can worth buying. |
