BeerID: 1095625
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Poured dark brown cola body with little to no lacing. Fig and raisin aroma
  atop dark malts. Medium sweet with the prescribed fruitcake effect some transition
  to light bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied average to soft carbonation reasonably
  smooth texture and a light bitter finish. A poignant name for a beer that I am drinking
  shortly after learning that TB are giving up! They have produced some excellent
  stuff along the way, even if this one is more novelty than classic.
