| **Comments** | Poured dark brown cola body with little to no lacing. Fig and raisin aroma atop dark malts. Medium sweet with the prescribed fruitcake effect some transition to light bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied average to soft carbonation reasonably smooth texture and a light bitter finish. A poignant name for a beer that I am drinking shortly after learning that TB are giving up! They have produced some excellent stuff along the way, even if this one is more novelty than classic. |
