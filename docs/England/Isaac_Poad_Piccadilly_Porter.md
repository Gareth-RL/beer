Beer: Isaac Poad Piccadilly Porter
BeerID: 709848
Brewer: Isaac Poad Brewing Co.
City: Cattal
Comments: Poured dark brown with a hint of copper in the body, tan lacing. Aroma is
  malty with chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the
  chocolate savouring the finish as well as sweetening the beginning. The palate may
  be a little thin for some, but it is not watery, texture has a little graininess,
  carbonation is average and the finish is bitter but with some chocolate. Overall,
  I think the mix of five malts works for me.
