| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with a hint of copper in the body, tan lacing. Aroma is malty with chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the chocolate savouring the finish as well as sweetening the beginning. The palate may be a little thin for some, but it is not watery, texture has a little graininess, carbonation is average and the finish is bitter but with some chocolate. Overall, I think the mix of five malts works for me. |
