| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma tropical - take your pick mango mandarin peach lychee. Appearance hazy, golden, frothy, white foam. Taste is mellow with medium bitter and sweet in equilibrium before a sour finish. Palate is medium body, oily feel, lively carbonation, long finish. It left me baffled, half suspecting I was missing an inside joke for Bristol craft folk. But that is paranoia for you. |
