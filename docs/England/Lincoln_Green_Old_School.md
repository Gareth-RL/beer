| **Comments** | Poured copper body white lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and hedgerow hops. Medium sweet to lightly bitter some soft malt and a bread and biscuit finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. There's worse out there . When did you last taste a bitter that blew you away? |
