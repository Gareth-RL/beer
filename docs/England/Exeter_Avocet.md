| **Comments** | Aroma of grassy hop and pale malt. Poured pale gold body and white foam top (quite a lively pour from the bottle). Taste is light sweet to sour with a glimmer of fruit and then a sour dust of bread malt. Medium bodied but watery texture and average carbonation for a bottled ale, and a souring finish. Part of a cluster of SW ales from our brief trip to Devon, where I was not blown away by the choice available, but then again, it was not a beer trip so I was not looking beyond the supermarket in this case and the nearest pub for lunch on the other. |
