Comments: 'Cask. Pours golden pale with white top. Some lacing. Aroma citrus tangerine
  or lemon rather than grapefruit Tastes predictably fruity at the start with growing
  bitterness. Light and with some resinous aftertaste despite its generally smooth
  character. A Christmas pale - needed like an Easter robin. But perfectly palatable
  stuff '
