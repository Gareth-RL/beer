| **Comments** | Aroma has plenty of citrus on the lemon grapefruit floral end of the spectrum. Pours hazy golden with thin lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a bit of pithy bite. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Good for a light summer session but hardly memorable. |
