| **Comments** | Pours dark brown with thin tan top. Aroma has cereal malty note: nutty, oatmeal, hint of liquorice. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with brown bready finish. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, although could be deemed higher for a stout, and a bitter finish. Overall, a decent beer with some complexity and charm. |
