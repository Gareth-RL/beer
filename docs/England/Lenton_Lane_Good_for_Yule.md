| **Comments** | Poured dark chocolate body and tan cream lace. Aroma delivers the promised chocolate caramel scents. Taste is richly chocolate with toffee notes giving way to bitter chocolate. Palate is thin to medium, soft to average carbonation smooth texture and bitter finish. One of the best cask stouts I have tried lately. I hope it is around for more than Christmas. 13/12/22 still good exactly one year later  |
