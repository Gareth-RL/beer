| **Comments** | Aroma has plenty of juicy hops yielding the familiar grapefruit, melon and pine notes. Pours a decidedly hazy pale gold with white foam settling to a lasting loose white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to sour with the grapefruit developing a thicker pith; some may dislike the slightly thicker soapy finish. The general palate is medium, oily feel, average carbonation that adds some fizz to the texture and then this thicker finish. I can imagine a session of this on a nice warm day. |
