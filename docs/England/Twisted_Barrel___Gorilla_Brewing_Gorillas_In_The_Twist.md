| **Comments**  | Poured murky orange with thin off-white lace.  Aroma of lemon and a hint of spice. Medium sweet to bitter with the spice note the main wheat beer feature. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  It's refreshing enough but a bit crude by German standards.
