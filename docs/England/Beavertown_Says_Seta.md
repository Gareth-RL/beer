| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours cloudy golden with rapidly fading lacing. Aroma is lactic and fruity. Taste is granny smith apples smeared with yoghurt, which might surprise the average Berliner. More a sour. Palate is light to medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, and a  sour languid finish. It will not knowingly cross my lips again. |
