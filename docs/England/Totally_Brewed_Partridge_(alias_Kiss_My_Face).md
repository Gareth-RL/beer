Comments: '"Cask at the Overdraught where there was a dispute over the name. But current
  pump clip was Kiss My Face and when I asked about Partridge it was said to be the
  same. Pours golden with thin white lace halo. Aroma is modestly hoppy. Taste is
  medium to light sweet and medium bitter with a biscuit malt note. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Whatever it is called
  it&#39;s a decent session ale."'
