| **Comments** | Cask at the Overdraught where there was a dispute over the name. But current pump clip was Kiss My Face and when I asked about Partridge it was said to be the same. Pours golden with thin white lace halo. Aroma is modestly hoppy. Taste is medium to light sweet and medium bitter with a biscuit malt note. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Whatever it is called it&#39;s a decent session ale. |
