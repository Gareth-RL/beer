| **Comments** | Aroma has the fruit that one comes to expect. Hands up, if you decide to buy a papaya to see if it tastes like beer? Grapefruit guava melon pineapple mango. Shake a tree. Pours hazy golden lace halo. The usual. Taste is mellow at its mellowest: pillow mellow, cottonwool mellow - you get my drift.  And sweet. Bitterness and sourness around the edges but sweet backbone. Nebulous fog. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel soft carbonation and a finish like the folding of angels' wings. I think I liked it  |
