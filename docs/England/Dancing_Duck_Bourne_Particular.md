Comments: '"Poured clear golden body with thin lace top. Floral hops and pale malts
  in the aroma. Taste is lightly sweet and bitter so a bit bland but easy drinking.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Many
  DD beers are better but it won''t kill you."'
