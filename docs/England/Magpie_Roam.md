Beer: Magpie Roam
BeerID: 565501
Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Aroma has toast, herbs, leather, and for me after a session of craft
  pales is underwhelming. But it pours a nice clear pale yellow with white lace top.
  Taste is medium and cannot quite decide if it wishes to sour. Palate is no more
  than medium bodied but the eventual sticky quality seems to add weight. . Carbonation
  is soft. Finish is twiggy which is unsettling. I fear that doing a craft tap takeover
  before sampling cask is not a sound practice.
