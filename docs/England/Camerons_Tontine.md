| **Comments** | Aroma caramel malts and berry fruit with a hint of nut.   Pours dark coffee with tan cream. Taste is medium bitter with some licorice root and almond nuttiness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not sweet enough for a milk stout and not full enough for a dry. A hybrid and overpriced here at Â£4.50 a pint. This is Nottingham for goodness sake. |
