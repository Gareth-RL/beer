BeerID: 137499
Brewer: White Horse Brewery
City: Faringdon
Comments: Cask. Aroma more malt than hop which is uncommon in a pale these days. Pours
  amber with thin lace top. Taste is similarly largely of pale malts with the hops
  barely registering except as a bitter languor. This also means that it builds sedimentary
  like as a clammy film on the palate so whatever the antonyms of crisp and smooth
  are, insert here.
