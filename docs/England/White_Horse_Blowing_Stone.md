| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma more malt than hop which is uncommon in a pale these days. Pours amber with thin lace top. Taste is similarly largely of pale malts with the hops barely registering except as a bitter languor. This also means that it builds sedimentary like as a clammy film on the palate so whatever the antonyms of crisp and smooth are, insert here. |
