| **Comments** | Aroma has a familiar citrus tropical fruit hop combination. Pours clear pale golden body with lasting white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a light finish. Session worthy. 01/11/19 second sipping. Still sessionable. |
