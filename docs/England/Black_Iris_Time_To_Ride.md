Comments: '"Can. Poured hazy pale golden body with white foam lace top. Aroma has
  pineapple and citrus hop scents with a hint of pale malt below. Taste is medium
  sweet and abundantly fruity with some mango and satsuma coming through. The transition
  is via a light sourness to a bitter finish with just a little of the mineral chalkiness
  at the end. Texture is medium to light bodied, a little graininess in the mouth,
  average carbonation, and the aforesaid finish. Seems like a decent NEIPA but I wouldn''t
  spot it in an blind tasting!"'
