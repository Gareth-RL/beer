| **Comments** | Tap at the Crafty Crow. Pours hazy honey gold. White lace top. Aroma unexpectedly butterscotch so II am at a loss as to where the tropical fruits associated with five hops went.  Tastes like a  malty apa. But in a  deserted pub with a clearly disconsolate barman I&#39;m reluctant to add to his impending sense of doom |
