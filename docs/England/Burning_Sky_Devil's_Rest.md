| **Comments** | Pours hazy amber golden body with thin white lace. Aroma has grass and grapefruit from the hops and a hint of toffee from the malt. Taste is medium sweet to drying bitter with slight metallic edge to the finish but still plenty of fruit along the way. Palate is medium bodied slightly chalky residue, average carbonation and the bitter finish. It does what an IPA should but that is why I prefer the darker beers as much as possible. |
