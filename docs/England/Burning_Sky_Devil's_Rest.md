Beer: '"Burning Sky Devil''s Rest"'
BeerID: 235770
Brewer: Burning Sky Beer
City: Firle
Comments: Pours hazy amber golden body with thin white lace. Aroma has grass and grapefruit
  from the hops and a hint of toffee from the malt. Taste is medium sweet to drying
  bitter with slight metallic edge to the finish but still plenty of fruit along the
  way. Palate is medium bodied slightly chalky residue, average carbonation and the
  bitter finish. It does what an IPA should but that is why I prefer the darker beers
  as much as possible.
