| **Comments** | Would you believe it smells of mango? Poured clear golden white lace.  Medium sweet to bitter with more mango. Medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  A lower abv than its earlier incarnation  as well as a different hop mix.  29/10/24 second sipping while waiting for a pizza nearby.  There are worse excuses.  |
