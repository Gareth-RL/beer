BeerID: 408190
Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap. Aroma pineapples and grapefruit. Pours pale orange with thin bubbly
  lace top. Taste is similarly strong on the tropical fruit. The overall crispness
  was accentuated by the heavily chilled temperature of the beer. But further proof
  of Black Iris as a rising force locally.
