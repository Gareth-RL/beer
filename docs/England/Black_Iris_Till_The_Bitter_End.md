| **Comments**  | Stratford Haven. Cask. Poured reddish amber lasting off white lace. Aroma lightly roasted bread malt and hedgerow hops. Toasty. Medium sweet to bitter fruit forward and malt finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Classic to style but increasingly the style is dull to me. 03/05/2024 a second sipping more by accident than design. But I was too harsh                                                                                      |
