| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma is muted but there&#39;s traces of tangerine and pineapples, maybe the dankness got in the way. Pours golden amber heading towards copper. Good white foam head.  Taste is medium sour to bitter. Palate is medium body, sticky, average carbonation, abrupt finish, but even without the crispness of the classic IPA, this one pleases. |
