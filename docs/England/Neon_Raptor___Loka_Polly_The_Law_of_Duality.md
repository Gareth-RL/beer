Comments: '"Aroma is the usual tropical suspects pineapple and peaches but there''s
  also a resinous backnote. Pours murky gold with thin and fading lace. Taste is medium
  sweet to bitter with the 8% very well concealed. Palate is medium bodied sticky
  feel average carbonation and a long light bitter finish. Overall a very good DIPA
  in terms of full and complex hops flavours and managed alcohol."'
