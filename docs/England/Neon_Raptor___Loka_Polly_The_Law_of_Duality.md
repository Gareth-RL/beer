| **Comments** | Aroma is the usual tropical suspects pineapple and peaches but there's also a resinous backnote. Pours murky gold with thin and fading lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the 8% very well concealed. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long light bitter finish. Overall a very good DIPA in terms of full and complex hops flavours and managed alcohol. |
