Comments: '"Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black with thin lace top. Aroma
  has dark malts with berry fruits. Taste is medium sweet with bitter background.
  Palate is medium bodied with oily rather than smooth or creamy texture. So while
  this remains a very drinkable stout I do ask what are we getting for the 7.4%. No
  great boost in texture or aroma as a stout so maybe it&#39;s a porter and I would
  rate it 3.5 if it were."'
