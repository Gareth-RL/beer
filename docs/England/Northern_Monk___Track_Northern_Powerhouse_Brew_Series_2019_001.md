Comments: '"Aroma is dominated by tropical fruit hops which was not always an IPA
  tradition. Pours murky enough to be an NEIPA. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter.
  Palate is watery like orange juice without the pulp. Soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish of no great distinction. In its defence there''s more here than
  in many a 3.3% cask ale."'
