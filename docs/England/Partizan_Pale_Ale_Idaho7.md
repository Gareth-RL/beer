Comments: '"Aroma of floral grassy hop. Pours cloudy orange with thin scummy top.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter with the latter dominant and languorous. Palate
  is medium bodied oily texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent
  ale but I doubt if I could spot it in tasting. It''s all about one hop."'
