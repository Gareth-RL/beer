Comments: '"Aroma has roasty, caramel, coffee, grass, butterscotch, vanilla, malts.
  I guess it&#39;s the honey. Pours dark chestnut amber with thin white lace top..
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to
  soft carbonation, caramel finish. Overall a pleasant rich tasting beer thanks to
  the bees of Beeston."'
