| **Comments** | Aroma has roasty, caramel, coffee, grass, butterscotch, vanilla, malts. I guess it&#39;s the honey. Pours dark chestnut amber with thin white lace top.. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, average to soft carbonation, caramel finish. Overall a pleasant rich tasting beer thanks to the bees of Beeston. |
