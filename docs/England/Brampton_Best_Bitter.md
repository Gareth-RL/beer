Comments: '"Not a strong aroma but a good example of a balanced bitter hop fruit and
  biscuit malt. Slight haze in the amber so not as clear as some of their pales. Amber
  body with white lacing. Taste is sweet but the main impression is the biscuit malt
  which dominates the bitter finish. Middle of the road and it''s a blast from the
  past. Palate is medium bodied oily texture, average carbonation, and a hyperbiscuit
  bitter finish--it builds.  There''s nothing wrong with it but just dull. "'
