| **Comments** | Bottle in beer hawk calendar. Aroma citrus and piney hops. Poured cloudy golden brown body with white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with definite piney bitter notes. Nice grainy earthy maltiness. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a long finish. A good start to the box. |
