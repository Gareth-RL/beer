| **Comments** | Aroma is dark malts - coffee chocolate lactose and smoky notes. Pours black with tan halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a pleasant licorice melding of the two. Palate is medium to full bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. If Baltic porters didn't have such a hefty kick I could become a regular drinker. |
