| **Comments** | Tap at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. If anyone needs a reminder of what cranberries smell like, sniff this. Pours clear golden white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to sour with a fruity spine. Palate is medium bodied oily feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. So two cheers for the cranberry side and one for the Witbier. |
