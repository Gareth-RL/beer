BeerID: 562941
Brewer: Brew By Numbers
City: Greenwich
Comments: Tap at The Crafty Crow Nottingham. If anyone needs a reminder of what cranberries
  smell like, sniff this. Pours clear golden white lace top. Taste is medium sweet
  to sour with a fruity spine. Palate is medium bodied oily feel soft to average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. So two cheers for the cranberry side and one for the Witbier.
