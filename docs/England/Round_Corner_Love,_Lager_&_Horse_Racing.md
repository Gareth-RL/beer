Comments: Poured golden body white lace diminished rapidly to halo. Aroma of roasted malt and spicy hops. Taste is lightly sweet to bitter with a surprising sweet spice finish. Medium bodied grainy texture average carbonation and a spiced finish. I liked it but I know too little of Marzen lager to judge well
