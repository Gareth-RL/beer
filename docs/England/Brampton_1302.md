Comments: '"Sugary lemony scent if anything. Not a beer that wins on scent. Pale copper
  deep golden body decent lasting lacing. taste is lightly sweet and this slides towards
  with a biscuit bitter finish. We felt it would accompany salted peanuts well. So
  there''s a selling point. and it tastes better with a full mouthful rather than
  a sip. I felt it was a bit of a throwback to older style beer. Some citrus fruit
  noted. Medium bodied or slightly more, sticky feel as it coats the mouth and builds
  on the palate, above average carbonation but that is a feature of the bottled version,
  and lasting biscuit bitter finish (very 1970s). Not a fan of the palate impact overall.
  It''s drinkable but it wouldn''t be the first we''d choose."'
