| **Comments** | Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours orange amber with white lace top mainly lasting. Aroma is pale cereal malt spruce, floral, hops.  Taste is light to medium sweet but medium bitter in the finish. Palate medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. My best bitter in a  while. |
