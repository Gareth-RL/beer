| **Comments** | I confess I seem to encounter passionfruit in beer more often than in its physical form. And if you are determined to produce a passionfruit beer then reserve a variant on Sex bomb as the label. Having said that the nose is a predictably fruity spicy combination. It pours a hazy orange golden body with lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied oily to watery feel, soft carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Easy drinking if not especially suited to mid December in Nottingham. |
