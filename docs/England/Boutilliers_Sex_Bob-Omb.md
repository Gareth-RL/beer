Comments: I confess I seem to encounter passionfruit in beer more often than in its
  physical form. And if you are determined to produce a passionfruit beer then reserve
  a variant on Sex bomb as the label. Having said that the nose is a predictably fruity
  spicy combination. It pours a hazy orange golden body with lace halo. Taste is medium
  sweet to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied oily to watery feel, soft carbonation
  and a light bitter finish.  Easy drinking if not especially suited to mid December
  in Nottingham.
