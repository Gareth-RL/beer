Comments: Poured black body tan lace. Aroma of coffee grounds and roasted malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with some coconut at the front but far more coffee right through to the bitter finish. Light to medium bodied slightly sticky texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. And it's back up to 6.5%.
