| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma has roasted malts coffee chocolate and a hint of soy and licorice. Pours black with tan cream top. Taste is medium to full sweet to medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied, soft carbonation, oily texture, long finish. Overall a good flavoursome stout and with the frisson of having a foreign stout from Staffordshire 31/10/23 second sipping 6 years on. Still good. |
