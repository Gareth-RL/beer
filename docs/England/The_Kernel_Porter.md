MyScore: 3.9
Comments: Poured dark brown almost black body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of predominating dark malts chocolate and coffee but a background hint of piney hops.  Medium sweet to bitter with fruits accentuating chocolate and light caramel.  Finish has grass pine and coffee grounds.  Medium bodied smooth texture average to above carbonation and a bitter finish.  A reminder for me of how good the Kernel can be, but to cavil it may try too much for the style and it's gassy.
