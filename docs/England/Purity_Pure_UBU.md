Appearance: 4.0
Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Purity Pure UBU
BeerID: 54254
Brewer: Purity Brewing Co (UK)
City: Great Alne
Comments: Cask. Pours amber brown with thick white foam top. Aroma bread, biscuit
  malts, hedge fruits and floral notes. Taste is medium bitterness, with some light
  sweet inflections. And that works in a bitter. Palate is medium bodied creamy texture,
  soft carbonation, and a  bitter finish. Overall this was better than I expected.
  It almost made the company tolerable. All beers £2.50 attracts the dross as well
  as the young dross. 19/11/24 bottle. Still a decent bitter.
