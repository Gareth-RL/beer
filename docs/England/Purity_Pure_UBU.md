| **Comments** | Cask. Pours amber brown with thick white foam top. Aroma bread, biscuit malts, hedge fruits and floral notes. Taste is medium bitterness, with some light sweet inflections. And that works in a bitter. Palate is medium bodied creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a  bitter finish. Overall this was better than I expected. It almost made the company tolerable. All beers Â£2.50 attracts the dross as well as the young dross. 19/11/24 bottle. Still a decent bitter. |
