Brewer: Theakston
City: Masham
Comments: Cask. Aroma fruit and caramel malt. Pours chestnut with thin lace top. Frankly
  in my youth this tasted completely differently. I would smile as soon as I saw it
  was on. Now it has dark fruit, liquorice and a slightly soapy finish whereas once
  it was Christmas pudding in a glass. Maybe I have aged better?
