Comments: '"Tap at Junkyard. Pours cloudy pale gold with halo of lace. Aroma of tropical
  fruits pineapple and lychee. Taste is medium mellow bitter but not simple since
  there&#39;s a lot of interference like acoustic hiss. The blend of hops argue among
  themselves in a sense. Palate is medium bodied, feel is sticky, carbonation is soft
  to average and once it escapes the final bitterness is crisp. There&#39;s a better
  beer Tring to get out of this one."'
