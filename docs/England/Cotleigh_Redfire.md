| **Comments** | Cask pours dark chocolate with bubbly top. Spicy aroma with a hint of cough syrup thrown in. There is certainly a smoked molasses edge to the malty taste. A light bitterness on the palate with some aeration but overall surprisingly fresh and light rather than rich and full. As someone who likes the fruitcake weightiness of dark ale I’m disappointed but I recognise there are legions who will be relieved. |
