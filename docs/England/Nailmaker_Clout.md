Comments: Poured dark brown tan cream lace. Berry hops and chocolate coffee malts scent. Medium sweet to bitter with pleasant malt sweetness and a berry hops tang. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  A decent stout from a Barnsley brewer that isn't seen often in Nottingham.
