Comments: Coffee chocolate malts in the scent. Poured mahogany with tan lace top.
  Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a swift transition. Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A decent porter but
  for Ada Lovelace I expected something more calculated to impress.
