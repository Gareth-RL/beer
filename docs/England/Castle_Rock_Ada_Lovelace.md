| **Comments** | Coffee chocolate malts in the scent. Poured mahogany with tan lace top. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a swift transition. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. A decent porter but for Ada Lovelace I expected something more calculated to impress. |
