| **Comments** | Cask. Pours golden amber with thin lace. Aroma roasted malt with modest fruits. Taste medium sweet and bitter. Average carbonation. The name is more interesting than the beer. 05/07/19 the above was harsh but the grading was fair. What are Shipstone's trying to do? 19/05/23 they are still trying but it's not working for me  |
