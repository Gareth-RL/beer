Comments: '"Cask. Aroma - you can smell the coffee and roasted toffee malt. It pours
  black with tan cream top. Taste is medium sweet and medium bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied with soft to flat carbonation slightly oily feel and a bitter finish. It&#39;s
  a black coffee beer and if I see it again I will urge it on others."'
