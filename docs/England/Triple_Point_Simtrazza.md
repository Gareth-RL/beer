| **Comments** | Poured pale golden body white lace top.  Melon citrus scent. Medium sweet to bitter with tangerine and melon in the taste and possibly guava. Light to medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Maybe, like racehorses, beers will have names linked to what's in them. Water, hops, malt = Whalt may appear soon. |
