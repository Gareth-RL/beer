| **Comments** | Cask. A winter ale. Pours rich dark amber with white lace. Aroma is butterscotch. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium + bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. I liked it and it would have tasted even better if the fire had been burning in the alcove nearby. 20/01/20 second sipping. Obviously seasonal. Still decent if slightly less caramel malts.  |
