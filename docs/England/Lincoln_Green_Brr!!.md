Comments: 'Cask. A winter ale. Pours rich dark amber with white lace. Aroma is butterscotch.
  Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium + bodied, creamy texture, average
  carbonation, bitter finish. I liked it and it would have tasted even better if the
  fire had been burning in the alcove nearby. 20/01/20 second sipping. Obviously seasonal.
  Still decent if slightly less caramel malts. '
