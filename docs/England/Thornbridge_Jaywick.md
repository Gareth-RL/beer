Comments: Cask at The Hand and Heart Nottingham. Pours pale gold with lasting white
  lace top. Aroma has peach melon and pineapple amidst pale malts. Taste is medium
  bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a biscuit
  malt bitter finish. This is the second American pale today that has ended with a  biscuit
  malt finish that I used to associate with classic English bitter.
