| **Comments** | The raspberries win the cherries come second in the scent scale. Pours a predictably full red pink with lace halo. Taste has said fruit and lactose note with a bitter finish. Hint of toothpaste. Palate is medium to light bodied sticky feel and long finish. A good example of a beer that would thin CAMRA octagenarians if it became the norm.  |
