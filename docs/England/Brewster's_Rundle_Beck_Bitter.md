| **Comments** | Can. Part of my rediscover bitter experiment. This one pours copper golden body with white foam top. Lively initially but rapidly diminishing. Clear for the most part but it does warn of sediment. The label wants to lead you but it does have a certain marmalade scent with a malty back-note. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter slightly stronger in the aftertaste. Palate is medium bodied, smooth enough in the transition but with a mouth-coating finish that lengthen the bitterness. Some above average carbonation at least when canned. Overall, it isn't as balanced as it claims. The first sweetness is brief and the final bitterness is one that sours in the aftertaste. If I was in a nice pub, I would probably have no complaints about my pint although I wouldn't have a second. (I suspect Ratebeerians rarely do). |
