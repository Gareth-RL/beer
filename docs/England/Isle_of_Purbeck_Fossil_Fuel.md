Beer: Isle of Purbeck Fossil Fuel
BeerID: 47757
Brewer: Isle of Purbeck
City: Swanage
Comments: Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours amber brown with lace top. Aroma
  has roasty, toast, nuts, on the malts side and lightly fruity hops grass, herbs,
  also evident. So shaping up to be a better than average bitter. Taste is fruity
  and thus lightly sweet to bitter. Bitter prevails in the finish. Palate is medium
  bodied, oily texture  average carbonation,and a bitter finish. So God is in her
  Heaven and all is well with the world. Does make me ponder a visit to the isle though....
