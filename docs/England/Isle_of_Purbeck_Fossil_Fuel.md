| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours amber brown with lace top. Aroma has roasty, toast, nuts, on the malts side and lightly fruity hops grass, herbs, also evident. So shaping up to be a better than average bitter. Taste is fruity and thus lightly sweet to bitter. Bitter prevails in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture  average carbonation,and a bitter finish. So God is in her Heaven and all is well with the world. Does make me ponder a visit to the isle though.... |
