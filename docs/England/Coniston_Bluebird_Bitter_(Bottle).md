Beer: Coniston Bluebird Bitter (Bottle)
BeerID: 5493
Brewer: Coniston Brewing Co.
City: Coniston
Comments: Pours golden  body white diminishing lace. Aroma dominated by bread malt.
  Emphatically a bitter. Taste is lightly sweet but rapidly bitter as the Challenger
  hops take charge. Palate is medium bodied high carbonation which impacts both transition
  and finish .  Mouth coating. I wish I could compare the cask version and is this
  a W Sussex score? Overall a good example of the style.
