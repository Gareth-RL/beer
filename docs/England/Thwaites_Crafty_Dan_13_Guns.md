| **Comments** | Can. Aroma: I puzzled over this since he initial smell was spearmint toothpaste but worryingly that may be the glass&#033; Decanted to another it smells moderately malt but with some citric and floral hoppy notes. The taste reflects this balance with the fruit notes of the hops somewhat blanketed by the malt with some rye evident. Overall and being aware of its corporate origins itâ€™s better than expected. |
