| **Comments** | Cask pours copper, thin lace head. Aroma hoppy fruits. Tastes like a classic bitter with shaper spicy flavours predominating. Watery feel. Resinous palate. Reminiscent of some of the older ales of my youth the Thwaites, Boddingtons and and Tetleys that corporate beer lords used and abused before real ale was reborn. Not sure it will fit now but fine enough. |
