Comments: 'Some pine resin, some peach and plum, but very little citrus in the scent
  according to my nose and a hint of butterscotch that alas may signal some diacetyl.
  Maybe it needed more of a rest.Poured a clear copper with lasting white lace top.
  Taste wise it is very pleasant with a sweet fruit and caramel note that softens
  to an easy bitter finish. Just not what I was expecting from a beer that says malts
  take a back seat. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation
  (given that this is from a can), and a drying bitter finish. The bitterness does
  build and to that extent it offsets the less expected or desired flavours. I suspect
  before I came on ratebeer I would have noted the butterscotch note as a good thing
  and carried on; now I know more about yeast! 17/01/22 on draft still flawed but
  decent enough in parts '
