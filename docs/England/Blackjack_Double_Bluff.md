Beer: Blackjack Double Bluff
BeerID: 246029
Brewer: Blackjack Beers
City: Manchester
Comments: Aroma has light citric hops and mixed malts. Pours clear amber gold body
  with lasting white lacing. Taste is medium bitter with some fruit but this is the
  most bitter amber I have had lately. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average
  carbonation, and a decidedly bitter finish. And I am bitter enough already.
