| **Comments** | Poured dark brown tan lace top. Aroma nutty malt  and berry hop. Lightly sweet to medium bitter with grainy cereal flavours but pretty dull. Medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Not sure it's a heritage ale worth keeping but it is the Mild in May trail after all  |
