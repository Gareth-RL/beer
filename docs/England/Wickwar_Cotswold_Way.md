Comments: '"Cask. Aroma berry and toffee but mildly so. Pour chestnut with tan lacing.
  Taste is balanced to the point of oblivion and I waited for the hoppy finish, promised
  in the commercial de&#083;cription and I could still be waiting. Brewers beware
  what you promise. A session bitter that will do no one harm but needs a Cotswold
  view to do more than that."'
