| **Comments** | Aroma has peach notes above pale malt. Pours clear pale golden with scummy lace. Taste is medium bitter with cereal breast quality. Palate is medium bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, bitter finish. More bitter than I expected, but still forgettable. It's turning into a session where I doubt myself. Surely I am missing something, but then I doubt that too. |
