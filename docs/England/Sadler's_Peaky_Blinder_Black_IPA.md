| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma roasted malts and spice. Pours dark mahogany with creamy tan head dissipating to broken lace. Taste has some chocolate malt and biscuit to the fore but it finishes hoppy and with a pleasant wash to the palate, although there is some strong herbal aftertaste For me a good example of a black IPA. And it explains why I prefer porter and stout. |
