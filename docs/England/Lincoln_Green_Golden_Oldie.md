MyScore: 3.0
Comments: @SJBW. Poured clear golden body thin lace. Muted fruit and pale malt scent. Medium sweet to bitter with a gentle hoppiness. Medium to thin, smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish. It seems odd to review a new beer that is a golden oldie. Presumably it will be better looking back on it.
