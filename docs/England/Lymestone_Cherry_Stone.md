| **Comments** | Poured light golden body white lace top. Aroma of pale malt and cherry fruit. Medium+ sweetness as the cherry is more evident in the taste but there is a transition to a grainy bitter finish. Medium bodied slightly grainy texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. But, as others note, it's undeniably artificial in flavouring. Not for the Belgians  |
