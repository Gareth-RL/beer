| **Comments** | Commendably the chocolate is more evident than the orange in the scent. Taste is medium sweet to bitter but the orange zest lingers. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a light sweet finish. The damage done to stout by Terrys chocolate orange is well known. But this is passable. A reward should be offered to anyone spotting the Alan Partridge reference. (Including me.) |
