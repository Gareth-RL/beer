| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy caramel amber with broken lace top. Aroma similarly strong on caramelized malt not sure I could detect apricot but dried fruit certainly. Taste is medium sweet in a sustained vanilla caramel kind of way. A single sustained note but a pure one. Palate is medium bodied, lightly creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a lazy lasting finish that melts away. Definitely a  beer I enjoyed more as I sipped. |
