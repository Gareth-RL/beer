| **Comments** | Bottle. Poured black bodied with thin tan lacing. Aroma has a hint of marshmallow. Taste is medium sweet with some berry fruits evident. Not much of a transition to anything else, just a fading away and certainly the smoke eluded me. Palate is medium to full due to the clammy texture, carbonation soft to average and a lactose finish. My first from this Heanor outfit, and while this is not a rave review, the beer is pleasant enough to ensure that if I have my way, it will not be the last. It's certainly seasonal fare. |
