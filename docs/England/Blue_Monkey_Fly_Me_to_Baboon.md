Comments: '"Poured reddish brown with off white lace top. Aroma has cereal grains
  and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a sour transition phase.
  Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Unsure
  what the aim was. I assume it''s a variant on 99 Red Baboons or just another example
  of never letting a bad pun die."'
