| **Comments** | Poured reddish brown with off white lace top. Aroma has cereal grains and berry hops. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a sour transition phase. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Unsure what the aim was. I assume it's a variant on 99 Red Baboons or just another example of never letting a bad pun die. |
