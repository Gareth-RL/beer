Comments: '"Aroma of grainy roasted malts. Pours chestnut body with tan lace. Taste
  is bitter to sour, which is relatively unusual for a porter. Palate is medium bodied
  oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall like Grantham''s other
  famous product Maggie Thatcher, it may divide. Some will miss it, others spit out."'
