Beer: Hook Norton / Mash Challenger English IPA
BeerID: 773780
Brewer: Hook Norton Brewery
City: Hook Norton
Comments: Aroma has orchard fruits and caramel malts. Pours amber with lasting lace
  top. Taste is medium sweet with more malt than I expected so the Challenger hop
  was a bit wasted. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a
  bitter finish. Session worthy.
