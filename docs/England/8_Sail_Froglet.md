Overall: 12.0
MyScore: 3.2
Comments: Poured golden body white lace top. Aroma of gooseberry hops and pale malt . Medium sweet to bitte: rapid transition so the main impression is bitter from both malt and grassy hops. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Nothing wrong with it but little memorable either apart from a hint of NZ hop.
