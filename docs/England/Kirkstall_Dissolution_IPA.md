| **Comments** | Pours amber gold body with white lace top. Aroma of pale malt and light citrus hops. Taste is medium sweet to Bitter with some biscuit evident in the finish. Palate is medium, texture is oily carbonation average, and bitter finish edging from IPA to ESB. A very English ale from god's own country. Keans Head Nottingham cask Second sipping 10/05/2024 decent and a substitute as the White Lion Beeston had no mild but was on the Trail 06/09/24 just back from Italy and in the mood for an English beer. This fits the bill. The Roebuck inn |
