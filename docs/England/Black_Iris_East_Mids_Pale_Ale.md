Brewer: Black Iris Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: I should drink more Black Iris. They know what they are doing. Aroma here
  is citrus floral hops edging towards tangerine with a vanilla note lurking unexpectedly.
  It pours lively from the can. Clear golden body and full white lace top that faded
  endearingly to halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with both citrus hops and pale
  malts evident ( lets state the obvious to excite the ignorant). Palate is medium
  bodied oily texture offset by full carbonation (I bloat as you read). Light bitter
  finish. Overall a beer worthy of pushing at the airport where denizens of Derby
  Leicester Nottingham flee for warmer climes but sadly worse beer. I liked it.
