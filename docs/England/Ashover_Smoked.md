BeerID: 223705
Brewer: Ashover Brewery
City: Clay Cross
Comments: Cask. Aroma smoked as a kipper. Pours chestnut brown body with full white
  head. Taste bready but dark rye style with stewed fruits and a prodigious lurking
  smokehouse. Overall I associate smoke more with mild porter or stout so this is
  a pleasant novelty a smoked bitter.
