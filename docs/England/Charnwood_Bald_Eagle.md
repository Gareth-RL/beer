| **Comments** | Bottle from Adventure Beer. And my first beer in a while. Maybe I'm rusty. The nose seems bready to me so the big hitting American hops clearly hit someone else. Orange copper body with full white lace so the looks are fine. Taste is lightly sweet to medium bitter with a slight tang in the finish. I get the malts coming through in a lightly spiced way but the hops don't give me the fruit that I expect from the New World. But as said, it's my first beer in some weeks. As with many bottled beers, there's a lively carbonation, but it's medium bodied, tacky texture and a tangy though bitter finish, maybe, just maybe hinting at grapefruit pith. I think I am going to try something else to reawaken the tastebuds. |
