Comments: '"Cask. Pours copper with white foam top and good lacing. Aroma woody, nutty
  pale malts. Taste medium sweet blending to medium bitter. Smooth finish soft carbonation.
  A bitter in all its grim familiarity.  28/04/23 second sipping and still a harsh
  judge of bitter. It''s hard to excel in this style "'
