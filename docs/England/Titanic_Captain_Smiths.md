Brewer: Titanic Brewery (UK)
City: Stoke-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Aroma is richly fruity plum caramel. Pours chestnut with foamy white
  top. Strong initial lacing diminishing. Taste is also stoned fruit with toffee malt
  but the sweetness is superficial and it has a bitter finish on the palate. Then
  again this may just be a barrel end.
