| **Comments**  | Poured dark brown body tan cream top. Milk chocolate malts scent. Medium sweet to bitter with chocolate and a hint of vanilla in the finish. Medium bodied watery texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. I can't keep up with LL output but this is solid                                                                                       |
