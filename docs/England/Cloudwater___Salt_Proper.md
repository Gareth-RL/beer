Comments: '"Aroma has dark chocolate malts and some hop fruits.  Poured black cocoa
  body with creamy tan too. Taste is poised on a knife edge between sweet and bitter
  and oscillates in the medium range before opting for a bitter chocolate finish.
  There''s a lot to enjoy within possibly vanilla possibly raspberry certainly coffee.  Palate
  is medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a long complex and finally
  bitter finish. A proper stout indeed."'
