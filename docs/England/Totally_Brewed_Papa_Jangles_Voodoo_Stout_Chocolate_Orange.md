| **Comments** | Pours dark brown with tan lacing. Aroma is muted, not very much chocolate and even less orange. Taste is dark malt with some insipid flavouring. Sweet but that is the best that can be said. Palate is thin for a stout with too much carbonation and an artificial edge. The original Papa Jangles is a fine stout and this distracts from that.  |
