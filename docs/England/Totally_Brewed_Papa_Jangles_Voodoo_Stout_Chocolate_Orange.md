Comments: 'Pours dark brown with tan lacing. Aroma is muted, not very much chocolate
  and even less orange. Taste is dark malt with some insipid flavouring. Sweet but
  that is the best that can be said. Palate is thin for a stout with too much carbonation
  and an artificial edge. The original Papa Jangles is a fine stout and this distracts
  from that. '
