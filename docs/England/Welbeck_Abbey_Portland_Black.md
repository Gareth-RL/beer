Beer: Welbeck Abbey Portland Black
BeerID: 151100
Brewer: Welbeck Abbey Brewery
City: Welbeck
Comments: Cask. Hints of coffee aroma. Very dark mahogany body. Bubbly cream top.
  But there the stout comparison fades and the porter/mild features come through.
  Roasted barley nicely matches the smooth chocolate malts to produce a satisfying
  swallow. Probably not as many swallows in a summer session as there would be around
  an autumn fire. But worth finding any time.
