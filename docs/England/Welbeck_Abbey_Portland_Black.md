| **Comments** | Cask. Hints of coffee aroma. Very dark mahogany body. Bubbly cream top. But there the stout comparison fades and the porter/mild features come through. Roasted barley nicely matches the smooth chocolate malts to produce a satisfying swallow. Probably not as many swallows in a summer session as there would be around an autumn fire. But worth finding any time. |
