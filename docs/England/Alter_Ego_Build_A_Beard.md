| **Comments**  | Poured hazy yellow, white foam top. I prefer my IPA clear unless it is NEIPA labelled. Light hop scent of lime and like from the Motueka. Medium sweet to bitter with not a lot to report other than it is citrus and then it isn't. Medium bodied, oily, average to fizzy carbonation in the can, bitter finish. Session, I suppose, IPA not really.                                                                                      |
