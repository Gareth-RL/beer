Comments: Cask at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours light amber with white lace top.
  Aroma has citrus and caramel malt. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium
  bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a dry bitter finish.  It was what
  it was, and I cannot see it making waves.
