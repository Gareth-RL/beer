BeerID: 112531
Brewer: Ridgeway Brewing
City: North Heath
Comments: Bottle. Poured amber body diminishing white lace top. Aroma has light citrus
  hops and bread malts. Medium sweet to bitter with more fruit and a fuller malty
  tone. Medium bodied, slightly grainy texture, average to soft carbonation, and a
  bitter finish. Only the label makes this a Christmas beer, and it has been doing
  the rounds for years judging by some of the other reviews. On the other hand, I
  have tasted a lot worse!
