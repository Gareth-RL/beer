| **Comments** | Cask at The Organ Grinder Nottingham. Aroma is berry hops and biscuit malt with only a whisper of the raspberry that is evident in the taste. Pours reddish brown with white lace sheet top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a pleasant juiciness that for once is not citrus or tropical. Palate is medium bodied, slick feel, average carbonation, and a lingering fruit finish with a little sourness. As a summer beer this gets my vote  5 Oct 18 a second sample and a spelling correction it&#39;s RASPBEERY . Auto correct lead me astray |
