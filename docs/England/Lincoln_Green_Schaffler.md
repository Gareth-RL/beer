| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with a tan cream top. Aroma of chocolate and coffee malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite chocolate and cream streak in there. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish with just a hint of coffee grounds. One of Blackshale's better outcomes. I could not tell you which American hops were involved since it is malt dominant. From Adventure Beers. Can. 14/11/23 a year passes. This time on keg at the Sir John Borlase Warren. My guess is Columbus hop. |
