Comments: '"Poured dark brown with a tan cream top. Aroma of chocolate and coffee
  malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite chocolate and cream streak
  in there. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish
  with just a hint of coffee grounds. One of Blackshale''s better outcomes. I could
  not tell you which American hops were involved since it is malt dominant. From Adventure
  Beers. Can. 14/11/23 a year passes. This time on keg at the Sir John Borlase Warren.
  My guess is Columbus hop."'
