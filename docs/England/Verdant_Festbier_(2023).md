| **Comments** | Tap @Junkyard. Poured clrar rich golden body white lace. Aroma pale malts bready with herbal grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite grassy hop finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. For me, this is a good score for a pale lager. Tap@Junkyard. Presumably 2024 version. Slightly richer malt scent earns a point.  But then again the hop taste drops a little. Hence, as you were. |
