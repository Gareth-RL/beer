Comments: '"Tap @Junkyard. Poured clrar rich golden body white lace. Aroma pale malts
  bready with herbal grassy hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a definite
  grassy hop finish. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter
  finish. For me, this is a good score for a pale lager. Tap@Junkyard. Presumably
  2024 version. Slightly richer malt scent earns a point.  But then again the hop
  taste drops a little. Hence, as you were."'
