| **Comments** | Aroma has some raisins but no rum amid roasted malts. Poured dark brown body with tan lace top. Taste is light to medium sweet with hint of spice and a bitter finish. Palate is thin to medium bodied clammy feel soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. As a flavoured stout disappointing. 11/12/24 second sipping and hoping for improvement.  Still not impressed with the scent. Taste is more bitter than sweet which rum and raisin should not produce. So still disappointing and more pump clip than reality. |
