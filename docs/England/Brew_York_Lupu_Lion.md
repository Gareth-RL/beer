Comments: Poured hazy golden body thin lace diminishing to halo. Aroma of grassy hops
  some lemon. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with quite a citrus acid kick rather
  than a smooth transition. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a
  bitter finish. Refreshing if a little lacking in complexity.
