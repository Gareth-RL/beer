Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours golden body white lace top diminishing.
  Aroma has tropical funk mango melon and tangerines but blended rather than in succession
  . Taste is medium bitter with a light sweet flirtation. Palate is medium bodied,
  sticky texture, carbonation soft, finish crisp. Not a blockbuster...
