| **Comments** | Cask. Pours amber with a white lace top. A modest balanced hop and biscuit malt scent &#40;you would guess it was beer blindfolded&#41;. The taste is similarly solid rather than spectacular with enough fruit to the fore to dominate the overall taste. A decent session bitter that has its place although the prospectors have moved on. |
