Comments: '"Cask. Pours amber with a white lace top. A modest balanced hop and biscuit
  malt scent &#40;you would guess it was beer blindfolded&#41;. The taste is similarly
  solid rather than spectacular with enough fruit to the fore to dominate the overall
  taste. A decent session bitter that has its place although the prospectors have
  moved on."'
