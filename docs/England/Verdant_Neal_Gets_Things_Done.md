| **Comments** | Tap at the Canal House. Aroma has spruce, citrus, herbs, and they fuse into mango and pine with the pineapples fermenting behind. Pours cloudy murky orange gold with white lace top. Taste is medium to heavy sweet to sour with a bitter ending. Palate is similarly medium but with thick feel, unusual in an IPA. Carbonation is average to lively. There is a bitter finish but it is not as crisp as some IPA. &#40;I used to know where I was with IPA but these days it is a far bigger band and I am an unreliable guide&#41;. Malts rather than hops are my thing. But this is good stuff  |
