Comments: 'Poured deep chestnut with ruby lights. Tan top. Aroma of roasted nutty
  malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a hint of toffee at the front and some
  spice in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter
  finish. For me a Christmas beer I could drink year round. '
