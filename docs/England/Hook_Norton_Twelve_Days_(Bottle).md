| **Comments** | Poured deep chestnut with ruby lights. Tan top. Aroma of roasted nutty malts. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a hint of toffee at the front and some spice in the finish. Medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. For me a Christmas beer I could drink year round.  |
