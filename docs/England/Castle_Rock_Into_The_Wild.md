| **Comments** | Poured hazy golden with white lace.aroma of pale malt and fruit gums. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a strong fruity start and odd vegetable finish. Medium bodied slightly gummy texture average to soft carbonation and a light bitter herbal finish. I won't seek it out |
