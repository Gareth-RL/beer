Beer: Downton Elderquad
BeerID: 59867
Brewer: Downton Brewery
City: Salisbury
Comments: Cask. Aroma may have a passing breeze of elderflower but it is easily overlooked
  and my nose detect toffee. Certainly yellow gold with a thin lace top that breaks
  but persists. Taste is smooth and balanced with a bready finish on the palate. The
  readiness with which one can foresee another is more apparent than the refreshment
  promised but well pitched.
