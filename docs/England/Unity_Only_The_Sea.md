| **Comments** | Tap. @canalhouse. Pours murky orange with white foam dissipating to broken lace. Aroma funky fruit pineapples grapefruit fore, mango and passionfruit aft. Taste is more sour than anything else as if bitterness and sourness are arguing on the sidelines. Palate medium bodied oily feel, soft carbonation, and long finish and yet palate is the least of its appeal. It&#39;s like great sex with the wrong woman. You won&#39;t go back but then again, ..... |
