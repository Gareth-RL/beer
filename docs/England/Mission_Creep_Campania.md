| **Comments** | Cask at the Crafty Crow. Pours black with thin tan lace. Aroma bespeaks the name vanilla chocolate and strawberry. Taste is emphatically sweet with strawberry and cream. Light bitter finish. Palate is thin to medium bodied some initial lactic creaminess but it dissipates. Soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. No one buying a Neapolitan ice cream stout should be disappointed but palate wise it lacks. ( God, I am harsh!) |
