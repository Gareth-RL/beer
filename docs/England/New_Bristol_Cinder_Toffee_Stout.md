Comments: '"Poured a picture of a brown stout with ran cream lace too. Aroma of toffees.
  Taste is very sweet but there is a little bitterness at the back. Palate is medium
  bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. If you don''t like cinder
  toffee (think crunchy you Brits), don''t go near."'
