Beer: Cloudwater A•W18 Brewed All Season IPA
BeerID: 668186
Brewer: Cloudwater Brew Co
City: Manchester
Comments: Aroma has the proverbial tropical fruit - pineapple mango grapefruit mandarin
  (discerning noses may add). Pours classic NEIPA murk. Mine had a white froth that
  fell away. Taste is medium sweet with a counter note from the outset of malty muted
  biscuit bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and
  a long ambivalent finish that sustains sweet and bitter rather than resolves them.
  The more I drank the more I liked. Yet one is enough.
