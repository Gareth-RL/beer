| **Comments** | Aroma has the proverbial tropical fruit - pineapple mango grapefruit mandarin (discerning noses may add). Pours classic NEIPA murk. Mine had a white froth that fell away. Taste is medium sweet with a counter note from the outset of malty muted biscuit bitterness. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a long ambivalent finish that sustains sweet and bitter rather than resolves them. The more I drank the more I liked. Yet one is enough. |
