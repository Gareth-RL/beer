| **Comments** | Caramel dark malts aroma. Poured dark brown mahogany body with lasting beige lace. Taste is richly caramel and chocolate sweetness with light bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied, clammy feel, average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I think both the feel and the carbonation detract from what is overall an excellent porter. |
