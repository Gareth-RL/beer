Comments: This has been with me since Christmas and needs drinking. Pours hazy purple
  with pink froth. Definite scent of cranberry and stone fruits. Taste is also sweet
  to sour with the cranberries and the plums eclipsing the cherries. Palate is medium,
  sticky feel, soft carbonation and a long finish. For those of us not known to like
  Gose, this is a novelty item and probably will be avoided next Xmas
