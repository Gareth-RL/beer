| **Comments** | A lager with more than pale malts Inthe scent. Gooseberry and lemon notes. Pours hazy pale golden with white lace. Taste is medium sweet to medium sour/bitter finish. Palate is medium bodied clammy feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. I am not a lager fan and it tends to be a summer beach experience but this is okay. |
