| **Comments** | Cask. Malty scent. Pours brown with ruby lights and a tan foam top with initially strong lacing.. Taste is mellow chocolate more Cadbury than Lindt. But overall reasonably well balanced which can also mean dull 19 07 17 I was too harsh. Aroma has caramel, chocolate, roasty, toast, all good malty flavours. Pours chestnut with ruby lights and tan foam, broken lace. Taste medium sweetness, heading towards heavy, lightly sour, lightly bitter, Balanced maybe if you accept that the finish is not sweet. Palate may be a conundrum only to me. medium body, oily feel, soft carbonation, long finish, But possibly different next time. |
