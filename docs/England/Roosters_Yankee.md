| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma a little fruity hops, where the Turkish delight went is anyone’s guess. Mine is a copywriter’s imagination. Pours golden white top, steady lacing. Tastes bitter from the start with a sharp citric rind flavour atop a plain biscuit base. Palate no more than medium with a strong carbonated finish. I won’t be having a second  |
