City: Keighley
Comments: Cask. At Walton hotel - so overpriced. Resinous hoppy nose. Copper with
  thin top. The awards come from its balance and it remains a beer that others should
  study precisely because they go overboard on hops. Or arcane flavours.If this was
  the only beer available I would be happy if bored.
