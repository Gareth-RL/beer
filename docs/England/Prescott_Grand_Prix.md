| **Comments** | Poured copper body diminishing off white lace top. Berry hops and toffee malt in the scent. Medium sweet with a slow transition to a light hoppy bitter finish. More toffee and berries to accentuate the sweetness. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish, but overall a sweet ESB that I would be happy to order. |
