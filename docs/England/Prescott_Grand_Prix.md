Brewer: Prescott Ales (Hanlons)
City: Cheltenham
Comments: Poured copper body diminishing off white lace top. Berry hops and toffee
  malt in the scent. Medium sweet with a slow transition to a light hoppy bitter finish.
  More toffee and berries to accentuate the sweetness. Medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish, but overall a sweet ESB that I would be
  happy to order.
