Comments: Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Aroma is tropical citrus
  fruits atop pale malts. Pours golden honey amber with off-white lacing. Taste is
  medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to
  soft carbonation, and a biscuit bitter finish. Overall a decent bitter for the fruit
  favouring.
