| **Comments** | Cask at The Sir John Borlase Warren Nottingham. Aroma is tropical citrus fruits atop pale malts. Pours golden honey amber with off-white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to soft carbonation, and a biscuit bitter finish. Overall a decent bitter for the fruit favouring. |
