| **Comments** | Cask at The Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours amber brown with white lace top. Aroma is pale malts and berry hops. Taste is bitter and then bitter again with just a refreshing bit of bitterness in the finish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and would you believe it a bitter finish. A session bitter. 3/07/23 still bitter  |
