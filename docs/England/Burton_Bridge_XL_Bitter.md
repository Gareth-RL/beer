Comments: 'Cask at The Room with a Brew Nottingham. Pours amber brown with white lace
  top. Aroma is pale malts and berry hops. Taste is bitter and then bitter again with
  just a refreshing bit of bitterness in the finish. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average carbonation and would you believe it a bitter finish. A session
  bitter. 3/07/23 still bitter '
