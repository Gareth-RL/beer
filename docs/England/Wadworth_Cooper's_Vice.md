BeerID: 359974
Brewer: Wadworth
City: Devizes
Comments: Cask. Aroma of blackberry and apples. Pours copper and thin broken lace
  top. The fruit notes carry into the taste but biscit malts and some background hoppiness
  add to the complexity - the second swallow tasted more interesting than the first.
  And this suggest that it builds on the palate. So worth a try as a beer that illustrates
  how hops win over fruit in the end
