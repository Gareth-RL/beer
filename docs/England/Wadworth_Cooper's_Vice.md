| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma of blackberry and apples. Pours copper and thin broken lace top. The fruit notes carry into the taste but biscit malts and some background hoppiness add to the complexity - the second swallow tasted more interesting than the first. And this suggest that it builds on the palate. So worth a try as a beer that illustrates how hops win over fruit in the end |
