BeerID: 52549
Brewer: Funfair Brewing Co.
City: Elston
Comments: From the barrel. Pours like flat coke. Remarkable scent smoked peat ash
  with licorice undertones. Maybe figs. Taste is predictably malty heading toward
  the medicinal cough syrup registers but with fruity sweet persistence on the palate.
  Given that this was straight from the barrel, the aeration on the palate is striking.
  If Rimmer’s alter ego on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; had a beer - this might be it. Smoke
  me a kipper I’ll be back for breakfast’ came to mind. A novelty ale God bless it.
