| **Comments** | Rich fruity aroma with pineapple satsuma and melon notes. Pours hazy golden body with loose white lacing. Taste is medium sweet with a smooth transition to a pleasant lasting bitter finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation[for can], smooth and a long finish. I can certainly imagine a session of this, although sadly not any time soon! |
