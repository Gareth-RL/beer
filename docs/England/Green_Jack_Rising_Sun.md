Comments: 'Cask. Pour golden with thin cream top. Aroma citrus. Taste sweet with red
  grapefruit and caramel malt. Slightly over-carbonated for my taste. Soft hoppy finish
  - medium body at best. The pale ales have become so numerous that it’s getting harder
  for the passable to good to compete. Especially in Nottingham where local brewers
  are outstanding. '
