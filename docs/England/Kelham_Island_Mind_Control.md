Comments: Cask at the Organ Grinder. Pours amber gold with white foam top. Aroma herbs,
  spruce, decidedly grainy but with a background bitter marmalade tang. Taste is medium
  to full bitterness. Palate is medium bodied, average carbonation, slick feel, astringent
  bitter finish. It dries the tongue. The only mind control evident is aversion therapy.
