Overall: 13.0
MyScore: 3.5
Comments: Poured dark brown, almost black body with tan foam top. Aroma of roasted malts and berry hops. Light coffee note. Medium sweet to bitter with more sweet malts and hedgerow hops. It certainly harks back to old fashioned stouts rather than craft pastry concoctions. But that maybe the Lancastrian in me.
