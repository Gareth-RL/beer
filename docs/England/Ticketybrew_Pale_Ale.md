| **Comments** | Bottle. Aroma has caramel, floral, herbs, cheese, with the yeast potently present. Pours hazy copper with a foamy white top especially if the bottle has been lurking at the back of a cupboard for a few weeks. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter. Palate has medium body, sticky, oily feel, lively, carbonation and a soft cream finish. Not sure what the aim was but it is a pale I guess. |
