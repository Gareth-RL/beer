| **Comments** | Pours hazy golden with thin white lace. Aroma has plenty of fruits guava and watermelon alongside the citrus suspects. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation and a light bitter slightly spiced hop finish. Overall an interesting pale. |
