| **Comments** | Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Pours a red amber body and a bubbly top but no lasting lace. Aroma has toffee malt that gives a sweet start to a strong bitter finish. Medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, growing bitter finish. An easy drinking bitter, God bless it. |
