Beer: Vale Red Kite
BeerID: 123212
Brewer: Vale Brewery
City: Brill
Comments: Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Pours a red amber
  body and a bubbly top but no lasting lace. Aroma has toffee malt that gives a sweet
  start to a strong bitter finish. Medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation,
  growing bitter finish. An easy drinking bitter, God bless it.
