BeerID: 39071
Brewer: Newby Wyke Brewery
City: Grantham
Comments: Cask. Pours golden with thin white head and good lacing. Aroma grassy with
  grapefruit citrus edge. Taste is nicely balanced with a hoppy crispness blunted
  by a smooth malt background. Easy drinking with a hint of summer. 27/07/24 same
  as it ever was.
