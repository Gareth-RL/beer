Beer: Kelham Island Rye Plains Drifter
BeerID: 291339
Brewer: Kelham Island Brewery
City: Sheffield
Comments: Cask. Pours amber gold with thin white top. Aroma is apricots and cheesy
  hints of yeast. The taste is not great. Malt stale bread and sour hops. And it lingers
  disturbingly like an assassin with a cheese knife. On the other hand there are cereal
  notes even if they are more oat than rye to my taste. And it reminded me of how
  little I like lychees.
