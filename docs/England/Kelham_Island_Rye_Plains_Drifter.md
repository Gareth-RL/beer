| **Comments** | Cask. Pours amber gold with thin white top. Aroma is apricots and cheesy hints of yeast. The taste is not great. Malt stale bread and sour hops. And it lingers disturbingly like an assassin with a cheese knife. On the other hand there are cereal notes even if they are more oat than rye to my taste. And it reminded me of how little I like lychees. |
