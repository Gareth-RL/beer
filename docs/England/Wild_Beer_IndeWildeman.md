| **Comments** | Cask. Modestly citrus un scent. Pours cloudy orange, white foam top. Taste has similarly fruits to the fore with some malt for ballast. I’m a little bewildered by it since it is so ordinary and average. It’s most memorable feature on this occasion is its iciness. Does a farmhouse pale require intense refrigeration? &#40;thought not...&#41; |
