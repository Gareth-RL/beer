| **Comments** | Pours dark wth strong tan head that produces a wash rather than lacing. Aroma roasted malt. Taste some fruit but mainly more dark malt and I did not detect the maple. Soft carbonation and no real finish. A bit bleh. 09/26/23 second sipping detected some maple. Oddly this sours rather than sweetens. |
