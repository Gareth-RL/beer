| **Comments** | Poured hazy copper body with white lace top. Aroma is strawberry vanilla ice cream and obviously not something found in nature. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a chemical syrupy finish. The more I drank the less I liked it.  Palate medium bodied soft carbonation but the aftertaste is hard to shake.  More pastry IPA. |
