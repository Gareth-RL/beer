| **Comments** | Amazed that I have not reviewed this before as it's been there for decades. Poured clear golden pale body with thin lace top. Aroma has a whisper of biscuit malts and berry hops but not its selling point. Taste is standard bitter with medium sweet start and a swift transition to biscuit bitter finish but not especially twiggy, if there are any left who cherish this facet of English bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and said bitter finish. CAMRA was started to save beers like this from something worse. We should be grateful and move on. |
