Comments: 'Tropical fruit scent, albeit the subtler end, guava, papaya, etc. No overwhelming
  mango and pineapple as is often the case.  Pours murky NEIPA style gold. Thin lace
  halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. There are hints of complexity and
  subtlety but too diluted. The feel is watery and thin and it maybe the flavour would
  come through more with some cereal support. I will finish it since I bought it,
  but if offered a sip I would opt for something else. Hence this is a public service
  announcement. '
