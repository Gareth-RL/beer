| **Comments** | Bottle at home. And as this is a rare thing for me, it may explain why I managed to pour a full glass of clear copper amber liquid with virtually no head to speak of (others allude to abundant foam). Aroma has rich roasted malts and dark fruits, dates and plums in my estimation. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with caramel or light demerara sugar notes. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average to fizzy carbonation, and a long finish. Not sure what they going for exactly but something eluded the goblin who seems more comfortable with a hob rather than a crown. 07/08/20 second sipping. confirms that is okay if not regal. |
