| **Comments** | You don't often see an Imperial Stout 8% for less thanÂ£4.00 a pint on draft! Dark malt scent some coffee a hint of licorice signalling more bitter than sweet. Poured dark mahogany body with off white tan lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter swift transition almost nutty earthy notes. Palate is medium bodied oily texture boozy finish. Curiously unremarkable as if the bits won't fit into a coherent picture. Drinks like the barrel you forgot for a while. |
