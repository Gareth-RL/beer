| **Comments** | Tap @the canalhouse. Pours dark chocolate with creamy tan top. Aroma has chocolate dark malts and cold coffee. Taste s medium sweet with bitter chocolate notes, but not as rich as I hoped. Palate no more than medium texture oily, carbonation soft with a bitter finish that is more ashy than languorous. It won&#39;t feature in my top 10. |
