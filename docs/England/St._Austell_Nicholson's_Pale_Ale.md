Comments: '"Cask. Aroma modestly grain bread malt and earth but unremarkable. Appearance
  is better with an orange golden amber body and a white thin lace top that stays.
  Taste is as modest as the scent.but the requirements of a pale in terms of pale
  malts and light floral hops are there &#40;insipidly&#41;. I don’t think the technicians
  at St Austell or the suits at Nicholson stretched their taste buds too much here.
  A craft brewer would have done more for the brand."'
