Beer: '"Bowler''s Trinity Porter"'

Brewer: '"Bowler&#39;s Brewery"'
City: Deeping Gate
Comments: Bottle from Beautiful Beers. Poured rich chestnut brown body thin tan halo.
  Aroma of dark roasted malts bordering on the liquorice. Taste is medium sweet with
  caramel toffee notes to begin and that slight liquorice bitterness in the finish.
  Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, average carbonation and a bitter finish.
  Very nice. I can imagine myself in a nice country pub with a good fire and a pint
  of this enjoying an evening of good conversation. And it will boost my low Cambridgeshire
  score!
