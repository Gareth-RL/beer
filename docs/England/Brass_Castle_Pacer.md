| **Comments**  | Poured pale golden body thin lace top.  Citrus hop scent tending to the pale variety lemon grapefruit and maybe lime. Medium sweet to bitter with quite a swift transition due to the hop mix, ensuring the bitter is lengthy. Light to medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  One for the beer garden.                                                                                      |
