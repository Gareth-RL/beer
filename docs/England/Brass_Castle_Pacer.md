Brewer: Brass Castle Brewery
City: Malton
Comments: Poured pale golden body thin lace top.  Citrus hop scent tending to the
  pale variety lemon grapefruit and maybe lime. Medium sweet to bitter with quite
  a swift transition due to the hop mix, ensuring the bitter is lengthy. Light to
  medium bodied watery texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  One for the
  beer garden.
