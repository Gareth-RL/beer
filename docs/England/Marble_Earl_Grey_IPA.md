BeerID: 182444
Brewer: Marble Beers
City: Salford
Comments: Cask at The Overdraught Nottingham.  Pours amber with lasting white lace.
  Aroma has just the right amount of tea atop the malt biscuit. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter. Palate is medium bodied with sticky texture, average carbonation, and
  a rich full finish. Better than expected.
