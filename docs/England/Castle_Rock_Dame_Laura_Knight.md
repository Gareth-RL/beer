Beer: Castle Rock Dame Laura Knight
BeerID: 369084
Brewer: Castle Rock Brewery

Comments: Cask. Modestly malty aroma. Pours dark brown with tan top. Taste is smooth
  and so well balanced as to be a bit character less - the chocolate notes for instance
  are thin indeed. A little viscous on the palate but bland.
