Beer: Thornbridge Lukas
BeerID: 400521
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours yellow gold with white lace top.
  Aroma is grainy and faintly herbal. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is medium bodied,
  quite sticky for a lager, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Only the Thornbridge
  brand could tempt me to this and in an uninteresting way it succeeds.
