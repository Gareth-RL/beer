| **Comments** | A pleasant surprise for a summer evening. Toffee malted on the nose. Rich mahogany with thin cream top. Predictably a lot to sort in terms of taste. Caramels and dried fruits predominate but while it coats the palate itâ€™s not as heavy kicking as its 6% might suggest. Still for those who like the sharp clean edge on the palate this is the other end of the spectrum. I can no longer imagine an evening of these. But I hope it reappears as the nights draw in. Mild Trail 2019 it has reappeared and is still good. 12/06/24 it missed the Mild Trail but its till good  |
