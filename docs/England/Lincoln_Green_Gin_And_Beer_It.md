Beer: Lincoln Green Gin And Beer It
BeerID: 421876
Brewer: Lincoln Green Brewing Co.
City: Hucknall
Comments: Cask. Served with lemon so that is what you smell. Pale yellow gold thin
  broken lacing. Tastes refreshing with some crispness in the finish and it was proving
  popular but if the brewer recommends additions it’s a bit of an admission of defeat.
  Getting a lemon taste should not be beyond his ken.
