| **Comments** | Cask. Served with lemon so that is what you smell. Pale yellow gold thin broken lacing. Tastes refreshing with some crispness in the finish and it was proving popular but if the brewer recommends additions itâ€™s a bit of an admission of defeat. Getting a lemon taste should not be beyond his ken. |
