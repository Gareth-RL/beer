| **Comments** | Can from the Overdraught. Pours reddish amber with thin, broken, off white lace top.  Aroma has cereal malts, bready, but with some citrus hops tangerine and light mango notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with more syrupy caramel or caramel syrup if you prefer. Surprisingly unboozy (beware!). Palate is medium bodied sticky texture soft carbonation and a long finish; the complete absorption of the 10% abv is impressive and I like a little warmth without a burn. Not a frequent drinker of barleywine and this edges back into imperial territory in my view. |
