Aroma: 6.0
Beer: Left Handed Giant Life Without Oxygen
BeerID: 694989
Brewer: Left Handed Giant
City: Bristol, St. Philips
Comments: Can from the Overdraught. Pours reddish amber with thin, broken, off white
  lace top.  Aroma has cereal malts, bready, but with some citrus hops tangerine and
  light mango notes. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with more syrupy caramel
  or caramel syrup if you prefer. Surprisingly unboozy (beware!). Palate is medium
  bodied sticky texture soft carbonation and a long finish; the complete absorption
  of the 10% abv is impressive and I like a little warmth without a burn. Not a frequent
  drinker of barleywine and this edges back into imperial territory in my view.
