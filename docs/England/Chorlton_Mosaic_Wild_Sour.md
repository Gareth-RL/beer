| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours amber gold hazy body with thin lace top. Aroma sour citrus, grapefruit pith and herbal notes. Taste is medium sour with a drying fruity finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, astringent finish. Overall richly flavoured but not especially complex. |
