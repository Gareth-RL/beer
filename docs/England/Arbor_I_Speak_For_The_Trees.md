Brewer: Arbor Ales
City: Bristol
Comments: Tap at the Stratford Arms. Pours amber gold body loose thin lace top. Aroma
  is tangerine citrus and pine with caramel malts. Taste is medium bitter sweet which
  blends rather than succeeds each other. Palate is oily, fine carbonation, slight
  bitter finish. Pleasant enough but the finish is less appealing than the start.
