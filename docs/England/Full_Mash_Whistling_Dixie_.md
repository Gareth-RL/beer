| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma cereal, floral, maybe apple. Pours golden with thin white top. More blonde than bitter in look. Taste has medium sweetness, medium bitterness, medium sourness, it&#39;s what is known as balanced. Full mash is better than this but maybe it is an attack on Confederate memory. |
