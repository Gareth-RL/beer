Comments: '"Cask. Aroma cereal, floral, maybe apple. Pours golden with thin white
  top. More blonde than bitter in look. Taste has medium sweetness, medium bitterness,
  medium sourness, it&#39;s what is known as balanced. Full mash is better than this
  but maybe it is an attack on Confederate memory."'
