| **Comments** | Light coffee dark malt scent. Poured dark with ruby lights. Off white lace top. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with light sour finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a bitter finish. I can imagine a session of this. I might not seek it but it could happen. |
