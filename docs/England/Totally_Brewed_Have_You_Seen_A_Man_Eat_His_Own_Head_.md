| **Comments** | Tap The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black with creamy tan top. Aroma has coffee and sweet liquorice which I guess is tonka bean. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a definite liquorice edge for me and some alcohol heat. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a liquorice ending. How much Tonka is good for you, I ask? And a  Noisy silence answers me. |
