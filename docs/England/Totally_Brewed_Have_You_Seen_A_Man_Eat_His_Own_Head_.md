BeerID: 668450
Brewer: Totally Brewed
City: Nottingham
Comments: Tap The Overdraught Nottingham. Pours black with creamy tan top. Aroma has
  coffee and sweet liquorice which I guess is tonka bean. Taste is medium sweet to
  lightly bitter with a definite liquorice edge for me and some alcohol heat. Palate
  is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a liquorice ending.
  How much Tonka is good for you, I ask? And a  Noisy silence answers me.
