| **Comments** | I eat a kiwi a day and so far their scent alludes me. So a de&#083;cription of them in abundance puzzles me. Admittedly itâ€™s a fruity scent headed vaguely towards citrus. A golden pale ale with thin top. The mouthful is certainly fruity rather than malty as one would expect. But it is not astringent as some hoppy ales are. Phrased differently it not crisp or sharp. The edge is on the back of the palate. Overall, good but. |
