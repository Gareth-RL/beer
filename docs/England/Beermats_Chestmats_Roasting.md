Beer: Beermats Chestmats Roasting
BeerID: 982516
Brewer: Beermats Brewing Company
City: Winkburn
Comments: Poured rich reddish amber body with thin lacing. Aroma of roasted malts
  and lightly spicy hops. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a little spice and
  nuttiness to get you in the festive spirit. I am drinking this in February from
  a bottle so that may be a challenge. Palate is light to medium, smooth texture,
  average carbonation, spiced finish. A modest but pleasant bitter. 02/12/24 second
  sipping for Xmas 24 which comes early in England ahead of European travelling.  Still
  pleasant
