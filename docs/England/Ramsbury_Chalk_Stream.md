Comments: '"Cask. Aroma hay, melon cooked vegetables, verging on rotten eggs, &#40;and
  I mean that in a nice way&#41;. Pours definitely golden with a white top yielding
  good lacing. Taste is light sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, and sunshine
  would probably help. Otherwise it falls into the pit if acceptability that is drowning
  in standard blonde beer currently."'
