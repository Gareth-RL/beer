| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma hay, melon cooked vegetables, verging on rotten eggs, &#40;and I mean that in a nice way&#41;. Pours definitely golden with a white top yielding good lacing. Taste is light sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, and sunshine would probably help. Otherwise it falls into the pit if acceptability that is drowning in standard blonde beer currently. |
