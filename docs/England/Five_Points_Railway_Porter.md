Brewer: Five Points Brewing Company
City: Hackney
Comments: Tap. Aroma strong malts with dark coffee dominant. Black body thin crema
  top. Coffee is even more evident in the taste where it slightly overwhelmed the
  rest. In this respect the languor disappoints since one expected more. But this
  remains the most interesting ale I have had in months.
