| **Comments** | Tap. Aroma strong malts with dark coffee dominant. Black body thin crema top. Coffee is even more evident in the taste where it slightly overwhelmed the rest. In this respect the languor disappoints since one expected more. But this remains the most interesting ale I have had in months. |
