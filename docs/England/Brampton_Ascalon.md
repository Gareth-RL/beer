Comments: '"Bottle supplied via Adventure Beer Company. Pours golden amber with rapidly
  diminishing thin lace top. I have been miserly with the grade for appearance since
  I like a fuller head on a bitter. Aroma of biscuit malts and light hop fruits. It
  smells like a traditional English bitter. Taste is light to medium sweet to bitter
  with that biscuit quality which either draws you to bitter or deters you. Texture
  is medium bodied, clammy feel in the mouth and a bitter finish with some graininess.
  Again, I would have preferred a smooth cleaner texture, but there is nothing wrong
  with it within the style, and it is quite a while since I tasted a bitter. With
  the right company and in the right venue, this would make an admirable session ale
  given its strength and representative quality; although I am conscious that it is
  a very long time since I sat in a pub and spent my time drinking the same beer!
  But a solid bitter.For those unfamiliar with the St. George legend Ascalon is the
  sword or lance with which England''s national saint slayed the dragon. Some of you
  who are gamers will already know this."'
