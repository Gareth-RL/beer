| **Comments** | Pours black cola body and off white foam top. Aroma gas sweet chocolate malts and licorice notes. Taste is medium sweet or more with mellow finish. Palate is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long finish. I can imagine this as my usual if I had a usual rather than searching for the extraordinary. |
