Beer: Thornbridge Ena
BeerID: 590974
Brewer: Thornbridge Brewery
City: Bakewell
Comments: Pours black cola body and off white foam top. Aroma gas sweet chocolate
  malts and licorice notes. Taste is medium sweet or more with mellow finish. Palate
  is medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long finish. I can imagine
  this as my usual if I had a usual rather than searching for the extraordinary.
