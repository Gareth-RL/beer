| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark with tan cream top that yields little lacing. Aroma is pleasantly chocolate with coffee notes. Taste is soft and fruity with a finale of dark chocolate. So the finish is good but the rest of the show is bland.  13/12/23 second sipping six years later and the same opinion  |
