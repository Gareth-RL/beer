BeerID: 563842
Brewer: '"Fuller&#39;s (Asahi)"'
City: Chiswick
Comments: Cask at the Canal House. Pours mahogany brown with ruby lights. Tan top.
  Plum porters rise and fall by their scent. I guess damsons get a pass. There is
  stewed dark fruit here but nothing special . Taste is medium sweet with a bready
  finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, soft carbonation, no great finish. So
  this will not convert anyone to porter who has never sampled the finer examples.
