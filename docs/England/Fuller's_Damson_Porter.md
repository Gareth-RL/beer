| **Comments** | Cask at the Canal House. Pours mahogany brown with ruby lights. Tan top. Plum porters rise and fall by their scent. I guess damsons get a pass. There is stewed dark fruit here but nothing special . Taste is medium sweet with a bready finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily feel, soft carbonation, no great finish. So this will not convert anyone to porter who has never sampled the finer examples. |
