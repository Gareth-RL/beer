| **Comments** | Cask. It pours dark brown with a cream chocolate head. Aroma sweet malts even hints of marzipan. Tastes sweet fruits and mild biscuit with a strong lingering finish of roasted barley and bitter coffee. That may deter some as the easy sweetness of the initial taste makes the aftertaste more striking. But for me a mild of quality. |
