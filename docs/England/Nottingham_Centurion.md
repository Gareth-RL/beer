Beer: Nottingham Centurion
BeerID: 134027
Brewer: Nottingham Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. It pours dark brown with a cream chocolate head. Aroma sweet malts
  even hints of marzipan. Tastes sweet fruits and mild biscuit with a strong lingering
  finish of roasted barley and bitter coffee. That may deter some as the easy sweetness
  of the initial taste makes the aftertaste more striking. But for me a mild of quality.
