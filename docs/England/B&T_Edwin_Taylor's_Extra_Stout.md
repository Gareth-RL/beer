BeerID: 26288
Brewer: B&T Brewery
City: Shefford
Comments: Tap from the barrel. Aroma is somewhere between smokehouse and outhouse
  with the malts roasted either crispy bacon or cheese and onion. Pours black coffee
  with broken flecks of lace. Tastes sour licorice and bitter coffee. As some one
  who likes most stout and porter I have to say this one is a taste I’ve yet to acquire.
  But the third taste was better than the first.
