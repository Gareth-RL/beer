| **Comments** | Tap from the barrel. Aroma is somewhere between smokehouse and outhouse with the malts roasted either crispy bacon or cheese and onion. Pours black coffee with broken flecks of lace. Tastes sour licorice and bitter coffee. As some one who likes most stout and porter I have to say this one is a taste I’ve yet to acquire. But the third taste was better than the first. |
