| **Comments** | Tap @ the Junkyard. It&#39;s a sign of my novice status that the Beavertown core range is still new to me. I have begun to detect some hallmarks. Hops yield a tropical nose muted with peach. The pales are seldom clear and have the required minimum white top - a circle rather than a layer of foam. Taste is commonly sweet to sour with a bitter finish. Body is almost always medium and texture hovers over the terms oily and slick like me over a phone keypad. Palate has soft carbonation and yep, the finish is bitter. All good but becoming predictable. |
