| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange with white lace circle. Aroma has the usual tropical fruit salad and a background biscuit note. Taste is medium sweet and lightly bitter but the fruit sustains the sweetness. Palate is slightly more than medium,with oily texture, average carbonation, and a fruit gum lingering at the finish. I liked it but anyone mistakenly seeking the crispness of other pales will be disappointed &#40;and rightly so.&#41; |
