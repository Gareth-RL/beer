Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours hazy orange with white lace circle. Aroma has
  the usual tropical fruit salad and a background biscuit note. Taste is medium sweet
  and lightly bitter but the fruit sustains the sweetness. Palate is slightly more
  than medium,with oily texture, average carbonation, and a fruit gum lingering at
  the finish. I liked it but anyone mistakenly seeking the crispness of other pales
  will be disappointed &#40;and rightly so.&#41;"'
