| **Comments** | Poured pale golden body with white lace. Aroma would generously be described as balanced but it's a dark Halloween night amid a less than perfect week so you ask too much. Taste is similarly demanding. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it is unremarkable. But it will do you no harm on that account (and that's me being generous). |
