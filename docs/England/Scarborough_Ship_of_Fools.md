Comments: '"Poured pale golden body with white lace. Aroma would generously be described
  as balanced but it''s a dark Halloween night amid a less than perfect week so you
  ask too much. Taste is similarly demanding. Palate is medium bodied oily texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. Overall it is unremarkable. But it will
  do you no harm on that account (and that''s me being generous)."'
