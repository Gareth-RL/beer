| **Comments** | Tap at Beerheadz Nottingham. Pours hazy orange gold with off white lacing.Aroma has citrus floral, and herbal notes from its Centennial. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel average carbonation and a long finish. One of the better single hop beers I&#39;ve tried  |
