| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma melon grapefruit and grass. Pours pale yellow with white top. Taste is predominantly fruits but biscuity malts in the background. Soft start with growing acridity on the palate. A fair session summer pale but little American about it. 04/07/19 this one was better on second sipping. Aroma and palate less insipid than I remember. Possibly the closest I will get to an APA today. |
