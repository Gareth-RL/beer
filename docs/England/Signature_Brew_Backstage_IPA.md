| **Comments** | This is a beer that is described in different ways in terms of appearance which may mean a variable recipe. Some speak of amber and orange whereas my can delivered a decidedly pale yellow, clear body with white foam head. Aroma is fruity with grapefruit, pineapple and mango noted. Taste is medium sweet through sour to bitter with a mineral note in the finish. Palate is thin to medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, and a bitter pithy finish.  Their head brewer speaks of enjoying three of these in the course of the night, but I think it would wear on the tongue during the second. |
