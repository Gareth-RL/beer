City: Chesterfield
Comments: Poured pale yellow gold body with thin lace top. Aroma given that it is
  cascade is lightly floral pine with less citrus notes detected by my notoriously
  unreliable nose. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a slightly acrid transition
  but the finish is sound enough. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation
  and a bitter finish. One ponders whether a session of this would leave the soul
  revived? But then again, this might depend on whether the soul is mortgaged already.
  Modern life. It makes the past so much more appealing than the future, despite the
  fact that most of us have not faced the acute existential challenges our grandparents
  did.
