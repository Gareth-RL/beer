Beer: Springhead Drop O The Black Stuff
BeerID: 117996
Brewer: Springhead Brewery
City: Laneham
Comments: Cask. Coffee malt aroma. Dark body, tan creamy top. It looks like glass
  of expresso with crema on top. Taste is smooth if a little thin. It certainly doesn’t
  coat the palate like a stout. So I might question the brewer’s &quot;lingering finish.&quot;
  But good for all that
