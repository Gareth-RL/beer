| **Comments** | Cask at the Sir John Borlase Warren. Pours pale gold with white foam lace.  Aroma has grassy hops bread malts. Taste is is medium bitter and lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average soft carbonation and a long but indecisive finish. Less a finish than a bitter coating. One prays for Matins. |
