Beer: Verdant Umbra
BeerID: 679835
Brewer: Verdant Brewing Co
City: Kernick
Comments: Pours dark chocolate body and tan cream top. Aroma has coffee caramel and
  some alcohol. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a current of booziness that works
  to minimize the creamy sweet flavours. Palate is medium to thin for an imperial
  porter, texture is sticky, average to fizzy carbonation which also thins the body
  weight, but enough richness remains to ensure a long finish. Overall this leftover
  from a Verdant tap takeover is representative of where the brewery is at; sometimes
  inconsistent and disappointing but often bordering excellence.
