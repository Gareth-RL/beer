Comments: '"At Rail Ale Festival 2018. Only the cream ale label drew me to it. Aroma
  is subtly hoppy if by that you mean faint. Otherwise pale malt and grain. Pours
  pale gold with predictably little head in festival circumstances. For me, it tastes
  like a bitter in the fog. Muffled bitter that has an after note of sweetness. Palate
  is medium bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, maybe lactose in the finish.
  I conclude that cream ale is no more my thing than lager. But then that is an Englishman&#39;s
  life: Trying everything and liking only what we like, and causing as little offence
  and embarrassment along the way, of course."'
