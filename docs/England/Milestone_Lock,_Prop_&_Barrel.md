Comments: Hmm.... Interesting. Although you wouldn’t guess from the aroma which is
  stale fig roll. Nor from the average chestnut body and thin lace head. And so to
  the taste which is complex and far darker; dried fruit, coffee, biscuit, licorice
  spice. They all feature in a way that I associate with winter ales. Thus fuller
  bodied than expected. More hooker than prop.
