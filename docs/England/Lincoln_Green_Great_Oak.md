MyScore: 3.6
Comments: Poured golden body white lace.  As promised complex hop aroma floral fruity herbal etc. Medium sweet to bitter with plenty of tropical fruit toasting on a pale malt base. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish.  I added my tuppence to the tasting panel along the way. And it is not bad.
