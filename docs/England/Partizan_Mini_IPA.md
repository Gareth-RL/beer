| **Comments** | Aroma has lemon and grapefruit zest. Pours cloudy yellow pale with lace halo. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft carbonation and a light bitter finish. It compared very favourable to the Dugges & citrus beer that preceded it. This one had flavour.  |
