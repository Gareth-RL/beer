| **Comments** | The label given you fair warning that this is a blueberry muffins inspired stout. So the aroma of blueberry lactose and bread delivers. Pours dark body diminishing tan lace. Taste is sweet to sour, although the blueberry muffins sweetness is never removed. Palate is thin to medium bodied sticky texture soft to average carbonation and a long finish. A novelty beer. Cleverly done but now I have tried it, I no longer want it. |
