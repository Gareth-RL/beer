| **Comments** | Fruity scent raspberry with a hint of lemon. Poured pink body loose lace top. Taste is predictably fruity with the raspberry essence to the fore and a bitter aftertaste. Medium to thin body smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. It does what it says but it's a little monotonous  |
