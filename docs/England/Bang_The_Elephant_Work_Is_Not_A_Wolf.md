| **Comments** | Can. Pours cola black with very little lace. Aroma is toffee malt with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is medium sweet with toffee predominant initially but a pleasing liquorice bitter finish. Texture is medium bodied, smooth luscious feel, soft carbonation and the liquorice finish with not a hint of alcohol burn. Excellent stuff especially since I have not seen BTE offer a Russian Imperial before. Dangerously easy drinking! Highly recommended. |
