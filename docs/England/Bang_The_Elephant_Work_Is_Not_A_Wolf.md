Beer: Bang The Elephant Work Is Not A Wolf
BeerID: 941702
Brewer: Bang The Elephant Brewing
City: Langley Mill
Comments: Can. Pours cola black with very little lace. Aroma is toffee malt with hints
  of chocolate and coffee. Taste is medium sweet with toffee predominant initially
  but a pleasing liquorice bitter finish. Texture is medium bodied, smooth luscious
  feel, soft carbonation and the liquorice finish with not a hint of alcohol burn.
  Excellent stuff especially since I have not seen BTE offer a Russian Imperial before.
  Dangerously easy drinking! Highly recommended.
