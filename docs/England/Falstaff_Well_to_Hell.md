Beer: Falstaff Well to Hell
BeerID: 512249
Brewer: Falstaff Brewery
City: Derby
Comments: Cask. Pours chestnut body with off-white lace top. Aroma of caramel malts.
  Taste is malty with fruit notes. Medium sweet light bitter finish. Soft carbonation.
  Falstaff seems to sense that May’s mild trail is a marketing opportunity. But this
  is pedestrian stuff.
