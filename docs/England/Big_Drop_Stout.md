Beer: Big Drop Stout
BeerID: 579682
Brewer: Big Drop Brewing Co.
City: Ipswich
Comments: Bottle from Beerhawk. Aroma has coffee and chocolate notes. Pours black
  body and a thin rapidly fading bubbly lace top. Taste is medium sweet with a little
  sour lactose. Palate is thin to medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation,
  and an odd toothpaste finish. Set against this is the fact that it captures some
  milk stout qualities at a notional abv which is impressive.
