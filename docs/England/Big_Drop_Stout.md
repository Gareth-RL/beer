| **Comments** | Bottle from Beerhawk. Aroma has coffee and chocolate notes. Pours black body and a thin rapidly fading bubbly lace top. Taste is medium sweet with a little sour lactose. Palate is thin to medium bodied, oily texture, soft to average carbonation, and an odd toothpaste finish. Set against this is the fact that it captures some milk stout qualities at a notional abv which is impressive. |
