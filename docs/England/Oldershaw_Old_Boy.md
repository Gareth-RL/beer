| **Comments** | Cask. Pours dark honey with amber highlights. Aroma of caramel malts. Tastes sweet to the fore and with a soapy aftertaste. Thin bodied and while the main effect of the malt base is pleasant enough, thereâ€™s something missing, like watching England draw 1-1 with Moldavia or the like. Apologies to the Moldavians out there. |
