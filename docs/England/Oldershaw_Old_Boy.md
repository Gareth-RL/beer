Brewer: Zest Brewery (prev Oldershaw Brewery)
City: Barkston
Comments: Cask. Pours dark honey with amber highlights. Aroma of caramel malts. Tastes
  sweet to the fore and with a soapy aftertaste. Thin bodied and while the main effect
  of the malt base is pleasant enough, there’s something missing, like watching England
  draw 1-1 with Moldavia or the like. Apologies to the Moldavians out there.
