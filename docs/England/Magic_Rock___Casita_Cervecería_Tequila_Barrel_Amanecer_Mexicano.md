Comments: '"Tap at the Brewdog Nottingham. Pours scarlet with little head to note.
  Aroma has cherries and berries. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium
  bodied, sticky feel, average carbonation, and a sweet finish. Sadly this did not
  ensure that Mexico beat Brazil. Otherwise it was a tasty Gose for a man who likes
  porter, mild and stout&#033;"'
