Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark brown with foamy tan/off white/ beige  top.
  Aroma is muted citrus with chocolate malt. I was expecting a variant on the Terry&#39;s
  chocolate orange. Thankfully it wasn&#39;t. Taste was medium sweet in fruit and
  strengthening bitter chocolate. Palate was medium to full bodied due to thick feel,
  carbonation soft to average, finish long and bitter &#40;like life&#41;. It made
  me re-think Black IPA as a type. And since we all look for confirmation, anything
  that changes minds must be cheered."'
