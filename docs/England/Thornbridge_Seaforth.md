| **Comments** | Light fruit and malt nose. Poured rich golden with thin rapidly diminishing lace. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a long finish. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to flat carbonation, and a long also flat bitter finish. I suspect it's not the beer early reviewers tasted. And not a Thornbridge classic. |
