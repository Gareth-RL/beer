| **Comments** | Aroma has coffee and hazelnut in pungent combination with just a smear of Nutella. Poured dark brown with tan foam head. Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter with a lot more nut. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, soft to average carbonation and a bitter finish. Enjoyable. |
