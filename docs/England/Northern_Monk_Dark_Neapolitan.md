| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Pours murky brown with ample tan foam top that produces a definite sheet of lacing. Aroma for me was more evident in the drinking than the initial sniff but that maybe a residual effect of a recent flight.  But the vanilla and pistachio found their way through my befuddled senses and maybe at the end I imagined a cherry note &#40;stranger things have happened.&#41; Taste is medium sweet with a little sourness at the very end. Palate is medium bodied sticky texture, average to soft carbonation, and a fruity lingering. What more do you want? |
