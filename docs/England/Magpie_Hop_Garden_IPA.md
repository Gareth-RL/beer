| **Comments** | Cask. Guest ale. Citrus aroma - more sweet than sour- more peach than lemon. Amber body,thin lace top. I was expecting a strong taste but this has a smoothness that masks its bitter edge. Perhaps a more discerning palate could pick out the varied notes but for me the fruit on the nose doesnâ€™t carry onto the taste. But still refreshing. |
