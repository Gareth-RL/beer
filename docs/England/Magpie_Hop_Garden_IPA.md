Beer: Magpie Hop Garden IPA
BeerID: 297438
Brewer: Magpie Brewery
City: Nottingham
Comments: Cask. Guest ale. Citrus aroma - more sweet than sour- more peach than lemon.
  Amber body,thin lace top. I was expecting a strong taste but this has a smoothness
  that masks its bitter edge. Perhaps a more discerning palate could pick out the
  varied notes but for me the fruit on the nose doesn’t carry onto the taste. But
  still refreshing.
