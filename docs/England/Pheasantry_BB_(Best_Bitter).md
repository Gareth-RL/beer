Comments: 'Cask. Light scent. Brown chestnut ale with white top. The brewery commends
  its moderation. This may be a new word for bland. But the bitterness is accented
  today by a slight over-chilling. Smooth enough but unspectacular. 25/11/21 second
  sipping. Looks okay. Hoppy scent.  Balanced. I was harsh last time 30/03)23 third
  sip. Still okay '
