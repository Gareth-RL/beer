| **Comments** | Cask. Light scent. Brown chestnut ale with white top. The brewery commends its moderation. This may be a new word for bland. But the bitterness is accented today by a slight over-chilling. Smooth enough but unspectacular. 25/11/21 second sipping. Looks okay. Hoppy scent.  Balanced. I was harsh last time 30/03)23 third sip. Still okay  |
