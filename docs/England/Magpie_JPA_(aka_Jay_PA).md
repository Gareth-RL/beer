Comments: '"Cask. Aroma the sour side of citrus - grapefruit lemon. Pours yellow gold
  with thin white top. Taste has a better balance of biscuit malts and hop fruits.
  The finish is bitter but fuzzy rather than crisp. It’s been a while since a Magpie
  beer impressed me. And that is not a good sign. 28 June 19 a second taste edges
  up my opinion in aroma and taste. There''s a lot worse out there "'
