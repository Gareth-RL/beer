Comments: '"Cask. Aroma rich caramelized malts. Pours dark copper with white top that
  curtains the sides. The taste is more modest: Biscuit and soft fruits with a medium
  weight on the palate and a lingering sweetness. Not sure what is American about
  it save the colour. But a decent mild all in all "'
