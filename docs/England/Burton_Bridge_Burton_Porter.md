Beer: Burton Bridge Burton Porter
BeerID: 5826
Brewer: Burton Bridge Brewery
City: Burton-on-Trent
Comments: Cask. Pours chestnut with speckled flecked top. Aroma yeasty, biscuit malts.
  Tastes of both hop fruits and malts so well balanced in a way some porters fail
  to be. Sweet at the front malts in the core and a growing bitterness in the languor
  So more to this than one might suspect or expect. 7/3/7/3/13. 15/Dec/22 Festive
  porter bottle Is it different? same dark chestnut body with rapidly diminished lace.
  Aroma bread malt. Still balanced but maybe a bit of citrus hops comes through. No
  Xmas spices (hallelujah). A bit thin for porter but still a long finish. Same score.
