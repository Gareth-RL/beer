Beer: Morton Essington IPA
BeerID: 101270
Brewer: Morton Brewery
City: Essington
Comments: Cask. Aroma earthy, leaves, herbs, nuts, resin, scents lurk. None of these
  spell IPA to me. Pours golden with white lace top. Tastes like a bitter with a characteristic
  twiggy rather than crisp IPA finish. Mislabeled by the brewer but an easy drinking
  ESB.
