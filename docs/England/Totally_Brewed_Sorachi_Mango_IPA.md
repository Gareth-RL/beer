| **Comments** | Tap. Pours a decidedly murky orange with a scummy top. Aroma has some mango and citrus and pineapples but mutedly. I had expected a Brewdog-style punch. Perhaps because it was served Ina Brewdog glass. Taste is similarly modest being medium sweet to bitter with a light sour transition. Probably the most disappointing beer of theirs that I have sampled. I'm leaving it. 11/06/19 I gave it a second chance. This time around, it's still murky but the lacing is purer. Aroma is herbal hop and caramel malt which remains a less than favourite combination. Taste is medium sweet with souring citrus. Not a mango I would relish. Palate is medium bodied oily texture average carbonation and a sour finish. My first sample was dodgy (it happens). But it is still below their best. |
