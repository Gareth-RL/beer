Comments: '"Tap. Pours a decidedly murky orange with a scummy top. Aroma has some
  mango and citrus and pineapples but mutedly. I had expected a Brewdog-style punch.
  Perhaps because it was served Ina Brewdog glass. Taste is similarly modest being
  medium sweet to bitter with a light sour transition. Probably the most disappointing
  beer of theirs that I have sampled. I''m leaving it. 11/06/19 I gave it a second
  chance. This time around, it''s still murky but the lacing is purer. Aroma is herbal
  hop and caramel malt which remains a less than favourite combination. Taste is medium
  sweet with souring citrus. Not a mango I would relish. Palate is medium bodied oily
  texture average carbonation and a sour finish. My first sample was dodgy (it happens).
  But it is still below their best."'
