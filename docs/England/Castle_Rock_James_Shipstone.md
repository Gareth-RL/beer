| **Comments** | Shipstone’s has a nostalgic reputation in Nottingham so Castle Rock’s decision to offer this variety may find a local market. No great aroma a little yeasty. Good honey colour and thin top. Taste is one of growing intensity with strong grapefruits’ in the lingering finish.Light beginnings are succeeded by a resinous palate. I can’t say I’m pining for days gone by. |
