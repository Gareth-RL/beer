Overall: 13.0
MyScore: 3.4
Comments: Poured copper body with white lace. Berry hop and pale malt scent. Medium sweet to lightly bitter with a persistent fruit note. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent enough although its Munich bitter subtitle puzzled me. Tried at the Mist Rolling Inn on Derby Rd Nottingham which has a changing menu and changing staff.
