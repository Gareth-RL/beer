Comments: Poured copper body with white lace. Berry hop and pale malt scent. Medium
  sweet to lightly bitter with a persistent fruit note. Medium bodied smooth texture
  average carbonation and a bitter finish. Decent enough although its Munich bitter
  subtitle puzzled me. Tried at the Mist Rolling Inn on Derby Rd Nottingham which
  has a changing menu and changing staff.
