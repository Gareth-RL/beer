| **Comments** | Cask. Aroma earthy with muted chocolate malt notes. Pours dark brown almost black with tan lacing. Taste has lots of roasted malt flavours with some berry sweetness as well. A chocolate finish on the palate . It improves as you go along.  Second sipping 29/09/19 the chocolate malts came through strongly both in the initial sweetness and the bitter finish. It seems not to take to the bottle judging by reviewers elsewhere.   |
