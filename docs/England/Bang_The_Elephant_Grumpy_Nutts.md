Comments: 'Poured dark brown body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of chocolate and hazelnut.  Taste
  is medium to full sweet with a bitter finish.  Rich chocolate flavour with enough
  hazelnut to mutter praline. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and
  a light bitter finish.  Good stuff in the Elephant way '
