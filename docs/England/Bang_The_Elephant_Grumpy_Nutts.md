Comments: Poured dark brown body tan cream lace top.  Aroma of chocolate and hazelnut.  Taste is medium to full sweet with a bitter finish.  Rich chocolate flavour with enough hazelnut to mutter praline. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a light bitter finish.  Good stuff in the Elephant way
