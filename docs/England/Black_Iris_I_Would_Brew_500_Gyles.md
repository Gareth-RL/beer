Comments: '"A purple blueberry IPA that''s what the planet is crying out for. Heavily
  fruity and ice-cream nose. Astonishing for a fogey like me. Pours deep purple with
  pink lacing. Taste is medium sweet to cream. Palate is medium bodied in an ice cream
  kind of way. I really enjoyed it but it was almost entirely un-beer like."'

| **Comments** | A purple blueberry IPA that's what the planet is crying out for. Heavily fruity and ice-cream nose. Astonishing for a fogey like me. Pours deep purple with pink lacing. Taste is medium sweet to cream. Palate is medium bodied in an ice cream kind of way. I really enjoyed it but it was almost entirely un-beer like. |
