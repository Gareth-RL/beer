| **Comments** | Pours reddish amber with thin lace diminishing. Aroma has toffee malts, and very, very faintly some peat. Taste is medium sweet to biter with again malt notes predominating. The promised heather eluded both my olfactory gland and my taste-buds, but I can live with that. Palate is medium bodied, smooth texture, but too much carbonation in the bottled version. The finish is medium bitter. Overall, a decent amber ESB but nothing special; all I would say is that it tends to be received better by the natives than when it ventures to Scandinavia! |
