| **Comments** | Poured cloudy pale golden body with white lace top. Aroma has the Citra floral tangerine output.  Taste is medium sweet to lightly bitter some pith in the finish. Light to watery body soft carbonation and a bitter finish. The texture may alienate some but as a session beer it's fine. Cask at the Good Fellow George Nottingham (once the Overdraught)  |
