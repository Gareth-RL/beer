| **Comments** | Cask. Pours yellow gold with white lace top. Aroma has more grain than fruit. Faint hop berry. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation, bitter finish. Not sure what the aim was, so can&#39;t say if they missed. Idaho used to be famed for potatoes. |
