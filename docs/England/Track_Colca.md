| **Comments** | Tap at the Overdraught Nottingham. Pours a decidedly murky gold with white lace top. Aroma has pineapple citrus grapefruit hops and pale malts. Taste is medium sweet to lightly sour. Palate is light to medium bodied, sticky texture, soft to average carbonation, and a light sour finish. The most underwhelming Imperial I&#39;ve encountered  |
