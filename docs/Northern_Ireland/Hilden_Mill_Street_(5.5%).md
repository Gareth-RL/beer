BeerID: 398906
Brewer: Hilden Brewing
City: Lisburn
Comments: Cask. Aroma grassy with light orange notes. Pours golden amber with a good
  white froth top. Sweet foretaste with soft berry nites but the hoppy bitterness
  grows thereafter. Not a sharp bitterness but a lasting one. I tend to prefer my
  IPAs cleaner and lighter so not for me.
