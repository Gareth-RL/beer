| **Comments** | @nottingham festival. Aroma somewhat opaque but certainly roasted malts. Appearance dark body with creamy off white top. The rich taste is medium sweet and then bitter. The palate is medium bodied. Soft carbonation, creamy texture, bitter finish. The best of the Irish contingent sampled. |
