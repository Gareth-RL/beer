| **Comments** | @Nottingham beer festival. Aroma has toast, cereal, basement aromas, earthy, funk. It pours murky mahogany with thin tan lacing.. Taste is medium bodied medium bitterness, bolstered by a definite long bitter finish. Not being a connoisseur of dry Irish stout, this seemed an unspectacular example. |
