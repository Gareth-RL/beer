| **Comments** | Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma is lemon funky and herbs, with some yeasty undertones. Pours a light hazy amber gold with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet, medium sour to bitter. Palate has medium body, oily feel, average carbonation, bitter finish that is sticky. Wasn&#39;t sure what to expect and not totally persuaded by what I got. |
