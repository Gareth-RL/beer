Comments: '"Tap at the Junkyard. Aroma is lemon funky and herbs, with some yeasty
  undertones. Pours a light hazy amber gold with white lace. Taste is lightly sweet,
  medium sour to bitter. Palate has medium body, oily feel, average carbonation, bitter
  finish that is sticky. Wasn&#39;t sure what to expect and not totally persuaded
  by what I got."'
