| **Comments**  | Amber gold body thin lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and piney hop. Medium bitter taste with just a hint of fruit before the bitterness sets in. Medium bodied smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I had no great expectations of a 3.8% pale West Coast or not. This is fine but no more.                                                                                      |
