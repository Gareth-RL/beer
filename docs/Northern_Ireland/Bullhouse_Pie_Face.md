Comments: Amber gold body thin lace top. Aroma of roasted malts and piney hop. Medium
  bitter taste with just a hint of fruit before the bitterness sets in. Medium bodied
  smooth texture average carbonation and a bitter finish. I had no great expectations
  of a 3.8% pale West Coast or not. This is fine but no more.
