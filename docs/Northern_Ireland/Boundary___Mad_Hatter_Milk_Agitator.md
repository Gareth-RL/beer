Comments: '"Tap at the Canal House. Pours a marvellous purple and pink &#40;so far
  removed from the classic beer look as to symbolize my journey as a beer drinker&#045;&#045;looks
  like fizzy Ribena&#41;. Aroma is emphatically berries so the hazelnut is more milk
  than kernel. Taste is lactic but that just moderates the sourness. Palate is similarly
  medium bodied sticky, average carbonation, astringent finish as the sourness escapes
  its hazelnut blanket. Overall far nicer than I expected which may translate into
  certain layers of American ecstasy &#40;since 1976 I have observed the American
  capacity for disproportionate delight with envy, awe, and condescension &#045;&#045;
  hey, I&#39;m a Brit, what do you expect?&#41;"'
