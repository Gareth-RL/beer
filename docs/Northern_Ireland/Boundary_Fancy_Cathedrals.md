| **Comments** | Poured dark brown with thin tan loose lacing. Aroma of cereals and dark malts. Taste has some chocolate and coffee and maybe a hint of dark fruit--medium sweet to bitter. Texture is on the thin side but with some graininess, carbonation is average and the finish is bitter. Certainly easy drinking and its abv makes it well suited for a session. All it lacks on this occasion was a decent pub. |
