Beer: Boundary Fancy Cathedrals
BeerID: 980793
Brewer: Boundary Brewing (Northern Ireland)
City: Belfast
Comments: Poured dark brown with thin tan loose lacing. Aroma of cereals and dark
  malts. Taste has some chocolate and coffee and maybe a hint of dark fruit--medium
  sweet to bitter. Texture is on the thin side but with some graininess, carbonation
  is average and the finish is bitter. Certainly easy drinking and its abv makes it
  well suited for a session. All it lacks on this occasion was a decent pub.
