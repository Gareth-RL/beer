| **Comments** | Tap at Brew Dog. Pours murky brown orange with diminishing lace top. Aroma has butterscotch malts and citrus hops but lime and grapefruit pith lurk in the murk. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with a light sour finish. Palate is medium bodied, sticky texture, average or more carbonation &#40;more than it needed&#41;. The maltiness is distinctive in this IPA. But it clouds like an APA and fizzes like a lager. |
