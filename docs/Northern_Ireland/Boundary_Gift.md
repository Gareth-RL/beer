| **Comments** | Tap. At the Lincolnshire Poacher. Pours black with tan top. Aroma dark fruit cake and coffee. Taste is medium to full richly sweet and alcoholic like the spongy portion of whiskey trifle. Palate full to medium bodied soft carbonation rich smooth texture and a long finish. An impressive debut for the Boundary. I hope it features in a Belfast Christmas. |
