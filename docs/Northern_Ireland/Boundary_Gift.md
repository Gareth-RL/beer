Beer: Boundary Gift
BeerID: 437439
Brewer: Boundary Brewing (Northern Ireland)
City: Belfast
Comments: Tap. At the Lincolnshire Poacher. Pours black with tan top. Aroma dark fruit
  cake and coffee. Taste is medium to full richly sweet and alcoholic like the spongy
  portion of whiskey trifle. Palate full to medium bodied soft carbonation rich smooth
  texture and a long finish. An impressive debut for the Boundary. I hope it features
  in a Belfast Christmas.
