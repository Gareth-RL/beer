| **Comments**  | Poured black body thin lace fading to halo. Aroma of roasted coffee malts. Smoky. Medium sweet to bitter with coffee light chocolate and ash. Medium finish smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Certainly smooth due to the oatmeal but also smokier than expected.                                                                                      |
