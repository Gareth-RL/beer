Comments: '"Poured dark brown body tan lace. Wonderfully rich, great coffee chocolate
  aroma. Medium sweet to bitter chocolate with a nicely spiced coffee hit. Medium
  bodied smooth texture soft to average carbonation and a languorous finish. If you
  see it drink it. I''m glad my 4,000th rating was a good one!"'
