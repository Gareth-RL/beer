| **Comments** | Grainy lightly spiced nose. Poured hazy brown chestnut body with off white lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Definite rye-bread note in there. Slightly fruity on the hop front. Palate is medium bodied, clammy texture, soft to average carbonation and a light bitter finish. I can image a winter cabin, a log fire, and several bottles to keep me warm. |
