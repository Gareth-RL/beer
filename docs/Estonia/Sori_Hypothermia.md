Beer: Sori Hypothermia
BeerID: 791147
Brewer: Sori Brewing
City: Tallinn
Comments: Grainy lightly spiced nose. Poured hazy brown chestnut body with off white
  lacing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Definite rye-bread note in there. Slightly
  fruity on the hop front. Palate is medium bodied, clammy texture, soft to average
  carbonation and a light bitter finish. I can image a winter cabin, a log fire, and
  several bottles to keep me warm.
