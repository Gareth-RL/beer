Comments: '"Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours black with dark tan cream top.
  Aroma has caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, notes. Taste is medium sweet to heavy
  sweet so it&#39;s a dessert beer. Palate is medium to full bodied, silky texture,
  average carbonation, and a sweetening finish. An excellent porter that could accommodate
  a softer carbonation and maybe a chocolate malt."'
