| **Comments** | Tap at The Canal House Nottingham. Pours black with dark tan cream top. Aroma has caramel, vanilla, butterscotch, notes. Taste is medium sweet to heavy sweet so it&#39;s a dessert beer. Palate is medium to full bodied, silky texture, average carbonation, and a sweetening finish. An excellent porter that could accommodate a softer carbonation and maybe a chocolate malt. |
