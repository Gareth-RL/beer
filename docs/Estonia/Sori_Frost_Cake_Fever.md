Comments: What better way to mark my return to England after 7 months in Italy than
  an Estonian imperial Baltic Porter. Pours espresso black with thin broken tan lacing.
  Aroma has coffee, chocolate, and a nutty hint of Tonka. Taste is medium sweet souring
  to a liquorice style bitter finish. There are still dark chocolate and Tonka bean
  notes throughout, and the alcohol is largely well managed. Texture is medium bodied,
  smooth, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Obviously not a beer for everyday
  but equally a good Imperial.
