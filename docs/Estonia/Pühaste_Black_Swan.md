Comments: Aroma of dark malts and berry fruits some light coffee. Pours dark with
  thin halo. Taste is medium sweet to sour. Palate is medium bodied oily texture soft
  carbonation and a sour finish. Quite a lot of fruit along the way which is unexpected
  in a dark beer so a novelty hence the name.
