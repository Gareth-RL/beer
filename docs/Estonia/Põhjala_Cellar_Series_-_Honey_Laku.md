| **Comments** | Aroma predictably has a lot going on: dark fruits amidst the malt-prune, raisin, date, blackcurrant; some waxy honey notes and like others a hint of coconut for me. Poured cola black with tan halo. Taste is medium to full sweet with just a licorice bitterness as a back-note. But the dominant foreground notes are the dried fruits and the honey. The ageing has improved the texture but only accentuated the woody taste that slivers between sweet fruit and licorice. Palate is medium bodied, remarkably smooth, average to soft carbonation, and a licorice finish. Those with ready access to Pohjala's cellar may be unimpressed but those further away, including myself are definitely delighted. I am even prepared to give them the nuisance of the wax protector on the bottle cap which managed to go in many directions as I cut it loose.  It's another case of thinking I know I shouldn't drink a 10.5% bottle of beer in the middle of the day, while simultaneously saying to myself but this is why I drink beer! |
