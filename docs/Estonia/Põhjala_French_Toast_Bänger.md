Comments: Bottle from One for the Road Mestre. Poured black body thin lace halo. Aroma
  of vanilla and maple syrup with a hint of spice. Full sweet with smooth caramel,
  maple syrup, vanilla and a spicy finish that aids to smooth out the alcohol. Full
  bodied, very smooth, soft carbonation and spiced finish. A typically expert Imperial
  from Pohjala. If it were not so formidably strong, I would drink more--but it is!
