Comments: '"Poured cola black lace halo. Aroma of coffee chocolate and whiskey barrels.
  Taste is sweet but with a whiskey warmth and smokiness. For me the coffee gets buried.
  Light to medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a boozy warm finish.
  There''s a lot to enjoy but from this brewer you expect more. And it is definitely
  a beer to share."'
