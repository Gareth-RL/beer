| **Comments** | Poured cola black lace halo. Aroma of coffee chocolate and whiskey barrels. Taste is sweet but with a whiskey warmth and smokiness. For me the coffee gets buried. Light to medium bodied smooth texture soft carbonation and a boozy warm finish. There's a lot to enjoy but from this brewer you expect more. And it is definitely a beer to share. |
