Beer: Põhjala Öö
BeerID: 298025
Brewer: Põhjala
City: Tallinn
Comments: Bottle from BirraGoGo of Milan. Pours dark brown almost black with tan halo.
  Aroma is richly malted with coffee, chocolate, even soy sauce in the mix. Taste
  is medium sweet with liquorice notes in a transition to light bitterness, with surprisingly
  little heat in the finish given its abv. Texture is medium bodied, mouth-coating,
  soft carbonation and a rich languorous finish. Probably the best Imperial Baltic
  I have tasted.
