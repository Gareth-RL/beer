| **Comments** | Interesting that the rye should help the cacao mimic coffee bean. I got the smell of espresso from this. Black body with tan halo. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with caramel at the front and just a hint of salted liquorice at the back. Palate is thin to medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Some heat so not perfect. |
