Comments: Interesting that the rye should help the cacao mimic coffee bean. I got
  the smell of espresso from this. Black body with tan halo. Taste is medium sweet
  to bitter with caramel at the front and just a hint of salted liquorice at the back.
  Palate is thin to medium bodied smooth texture average to soft carbonation and a
  bitter finish. Some heat so not perfect.
