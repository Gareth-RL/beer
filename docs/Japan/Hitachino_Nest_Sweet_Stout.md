| **Comments**  | Poured black body with cream tan lace top. The aroma is chocolate malt and lactose. Its taste is sweet and milky with only a background note of coffee or chocolate and these are muted flavours that cannot compete with the lactose sugar. Medium bodied, smooth to sticky texture and no great transition to speak of. Average to soft carbonation and a sticky finish. I guess it warns you on the label.                                                                                      |
